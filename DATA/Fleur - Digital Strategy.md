**SME INSIGHT**

SEO
• Veel focus om de salesflow te optimaliseren, maar te weinig focus om men
(organisch) in die flow te krijgen
• Onvoldoende ècht goede en unieke content waarmee in elke fase van de funnel
een bezoeker wordt aangesproken
• Sitespeed (en technische SEO over het algemeen) is vrij slecht en krijgt intern
geen prioriteit
Social
• Privacy first visie limiteert server-to-server implementatie waardoor kwalitatieve
signalen ontbreken
• Creatieve slagkracht voor sales activation campagnes ontbreekt
• Omnichannel benadering ontbreekt waardoor (incrementele) groei
gebottlenecked kan worden
Display:
• Campaign hygiene could be improved: implementing frequency capping,
optimizing schedule targeting, ensuring mobile-optimized video formats (e.g.,
9:16), and having critical checks on the audiences currently being used. For
instance, they mentioned relying on Affinity audiences for sales campaigns,
which may not always be the best choice.
• Frequent and last-minute campaign changes or adjustments negatively impact
testing new strategies, innovative initiatives or ideas.
• The biggest challenges include small retargeting audiences due to consent
limitations and process inefficiencies between departments (e.g., pixel
implementation not being handled properly). Which ofcourse negatively impacts
the sales campaigns.
• Capacity and expertise is also an issue: While they have large departments,
there are very few experts, making the team heavily dependent on the agency for
expertise and support. Geeraths, Felix I think this one applies for Media as a
whole, at least accordig to Tim.
Affiliates:
• There is not always sufficient demand from affiliates to increase or spend the
budget. Additionally, if Vattenfall fall below the 3rd or 5th position, publishers
may replace them with competitors.
• And ofcourse the high churn-rate of PCWs. A potential opportunity is to explore
alternative payment models for PCWs or different propositions, tailored offers
and messaging - however Rob mentioned that this one is in the making.
• Not all traffic from upper-funnel campaigns or other channels is of high quality,
which may impact conversion rates in the lower funnel. Geeraths, Felix this was
the answer to your question, so you might have already included it under the
overall media insights.
SEA
• Audience targeting wordt niet ingezet door consent-issues, wat leidt tot gemiste
kansen om bestaande klanten en prospects gericht te benaderen en de
customer journey te personaliseren
• Een aantal interessantse tools zoals Performance Max en Enhanced Conversions
worden nog niet ingezet
• Beperkte focus op leadgeneratie - mail-offerte conversies, worden niet gemeten,
waardoor waardevolle inzichten en kansen om sales te optimaliseren verloren
gaan
• Er wordt geen onderscheid gemaakt in potentiële waarde prospects op basis van
proposities
Marketing automation
• Sales funnel heeft veel uitvalmomenten en is niet afgestemd op verschillende
klantintenties. Het idee is om in de toekomst met lead scoring te werken
• Tekort aan sales funnel-assets voor leadgeneratie en gebrek aan opt-ins.
• Het ontwikkelen van landingspagina’s en content is gefragmenteerd en wordt
door verschillende teams uitgevoerd
• Lead management moet meer gericht zijn op vraag, aanbod en advies van de
klant ipv sales pushes. Kans ligt in kijken naar de behoeften van de klant,
relevante content en opvolg emails.
CRO
• Vattenfall is using lots of industry related jargon and has a whole lot of content
for diverse types of energy contracts. Visitors find this hard to understand at
times. Therefore optimizing the content and simplifying this could be a big
opportunity.
• Visitors have a hard time understanding how energy contracts and pricing works.
Finding a way to be fully transparent in terms of pricing and also making sure it’s
100% clear on what that means for the visitor is a big opportunity.
• Vattenfall is still in the early stages of exploring how they can use dynamic pricing
for their contracts. Segmentation and being able to create dynamic contracts /
pricing is a big opportunity.
• User research / testing is very limited or not being done in the design phase. They
are in the process of implementing tooling for this and making steps into
customer journey mapping. However there is still a big opportunity in combining
all of the quantitative and qualitative data / research into learnings and making
sure all teams can use that knowledge.

OK, um, all good. So Wilco, can we start by you briefly sharing, uh, your
journey with Bafo and, uh, your role and everything that it comprises?
W Wilco 0:13
Over the last 10years, you mean?
G Giovanna 0:15
Oh damn, can we shorten that up to 5? No, I'm kidding. Please tell us
your journey. Uh, we're curious to know.
W Wilco 0:22
Uh, my journey, I, I, I, my journey started before, uh, I, I'm started by, um,
it was Studeberg.
W Wilco 0:33
They they are doing jobsfor young professionals and students. And they
are learning the online marketing disciplines.
W Wilco 0:42
So, um, um, uh, for example, page search and something like an added
team with a lot of guys therewho are, um, specifics steering the
channels. And one thing I didwas set up an insurance label for young
professionals called Burt. It's still there in the Netherlands, so I see also
things on TV, so it was very nice.

W Wilco 1:08
And after and after that, I, I go to iO. ibo is a daily platform of Yeah, daily
dealsfrom home and living to technical things like TVs, uh, and I, yeah, I
set up the two new platforms, home and living and Health and beauty,
because I saw we only had, um, alignment with the techie ones, but we
had more people there. So I set up the two platforms and I made a
whole, um, online plan to grow. Andwhile Iwas sitting on the tablewith
the investors, they say, no, we're not going to do it. They're gonna, OK,
so I say, OK, I'm gonna leave because Iwant to want to move forward,
and they don't, they don't want to invest and I said, OK, we need this
really to grow.
W Wilco 1:53
And then I came to a new one. It was a new one before, so how long
ago? 10years ago. Yeah, I think. Next year in January 12years. I Iwas
starting at a conversion manager, so my background is really design,
graphic design, and I do a lot of testing.
W Wilco 2:19
So I be multivariate and now also in my team we have a separate CO
team we do daily IB test.
W Wilco 2:27
So I do that and um um a couple of years later Iwas the product owner
because I really like to renew my my jobs. So after a couple of years, I
was, Iwas ready for other things. Iwill be the product of 44, the job
was
done already did now. So, um, and then it's, I say, OK, Iwant something
else, and I say I have a lot of experience in the channels, and, um, and I
think I can motivate the team to grow. So and then we had a little, yeah,
we had awe had a little of a big team. And I said to my mentor, OK, is it
possible that I get a role, uh, between steering the people and, uh,
helping them grow? Because I know a lot of online marketing. And then
we, uh, create the role, like, I don't know how you create a role. It's, it's
maybe I can form one. I don't know how it how what wording is, but Um,
it wasfor me a test one, if I like it, to combine steering peoplewith the
management skills together withuh helping them to grow on their
experience, their behavior and their knowledge. And then my current
manager leaves, so the rolewas, was there. And Iwas going to his chair,
and now I'm there for. Yeah, a lot of years. So, um, I think starting to get
uh the basic rights to get a set up with the team andwhat I really I think
the best is you get only output of the team if there is a team with trust
and safety. And if you give the right context to the team, OK, where do
wewant to go andwhat do you
want to do. So I really invest in and bring
safety and bring trust in the team, uh, to, to create a feedback culture
together to make each other better. And from that side, wewant to
grow. And now the last year, we have a PO on the team who are doing
the daily business. And I'm focusing on long-term things. So one of
these is the Accenture part, but also, uh, also what they're doingwith
lead strategy, um, um, so more folksfor strategic thing and for long term
things, and not only on the digital parts, but also on the, the facilitates
we need, add something like data, content.
W Wilco 4:47
Think about how shouldwe make the marketingMCO teams more data
driven, more tests on methodology, becausewhat I see is that digital
DNA in Waterfall, especially inMCO, is, is lower than what we have in the
digital sales.
W Wilco 5:04
So our challenge is to get everything on the same page.
G Giovanna 5:08
So sorry, so you're saying that uh that for for for a customer manager,
we lack data or the culture of
using data to Yeah, I thinkwe lack the
culture of that.
W Wilco 5:22
What we see in my team I thinkwe really do it, so I say I make a plan to
invest in CXO daily testing and and based on short optimizations, uh,
increased conversion, for example, my profiles based on their profiles,
push other proposition. Andwhat you see in the other teams like
Customer forLife, the A Team.
W Wilco 5:42
And also really the purpose of marketing. The data-driven work is not
there. So CXO and something like that is also not coming becausewhen
you're not working as data driven, there's also no a call for a B testing
and experimentation. So what I'm doing is we startedwithwith our team,
with a team of Dan, andweuse that as a book, and now I make a plan to
to make it scalable and to to to push data-driven profiles in the team to
let them seewhat they didn't know. So I think that I think that's the
problem. I really struggle from digital sales is that I think. Yeah, we are
far away digital. I think ifwe go to e-mer, for example, they say, oh, nice,
you have a nice acco and do very nice things. But the knowledge in the
teams isfar behind. So there's a really big gap is what we are doing and
what we see in case in what people know and how people can be more
digital. So it really uh spread for us.
W Wouter 6:48
Which teams specifically?
W Wilco 6:51
I think Customer for life and the A Team.
W Wouter 6:54
What, so customersforLife isfor retention.
W Wilco 6:59
They're doing retention campaigns. Um, That's the You say it's uh the
team of Simon, right?
W Wouter 7:11
Yes, yes, yes, would you say, would you say they are more traditional
marketinguh focused on, yeah, and and I think the challengewe have is
that we have.
W Wilco 7:23
Uh, we have a lot of stu
ff to do with the operational parts, so we have
facilitating teams in the back end. So for example, when wewant to
make contact for different platforms and to or we have to make a
proposition, we need several systems to get it up to speed. So what you
see, for example, in some teams is that, yeah, most of the time go to
current business and current business is really part of focus on
proposition and propositions are based on putting data or putting things
in systems. So they are not coming out to make a morevision, um, so
they are more operational facilitating teams. So, and the challenge of
digital sales is that we are, some of the capacity we need is in that team.
So I'm in another conflict is not the right word, but I'm in discussion with
the pay off and yeah, we have a case for online. I need your content
manager. To help me to reach that goal instead and then she said, yeah,
but I also have this and this and this and this and this so. I thinkwe need
to go to a to a setup.
W Wilco 8:29
That is not uhuh doable. The capabilities you needwithin your team are
your other teams.
W Wilco 8:37
You know, and also why you have a different knowledge or seeing about
digital, it's, it's very difficult why do we need it and uh so so you're
saying all of the good data-driven initiatives automatically gets placed
on the low on the priority list, yeah, so, so. Yeah, and I have to go to, to
sit with the PO, see the back law, steer the manager. Why do you put the
capacity to do in this because mine is very high. So yeah, I think, I think
we have to make more, we have multiple disciplinary teams, but digital
sales is one of the teams that some capabilities are outside of the team.
F Felix 9:17
Yeah, and for example, um, um, I, I think you're, you'reusing last click
attribution means right at the moment, yeah, so, uh, switching to multi-
touch attribution would also be part of, I, I think your priority, uh, or at
least a smarter form of attribution, but, um, the case, uh. To get it
pushed through and she has to be made because of, you know, the
digital understanding from the other teams if if I'm not mistaken. I don't
see the addedvalue in it or have discussions about everyone to be more
data driven and now we're starting Felix withMM and MMA models, so
attribution models and media mix modeling.
W Wilco 10:06
We already, we're already there, but it's mostly for the, for the digital
channels. I mean also add TV and radio on there, but Uh yeah,
sometimes it's difficult, so we are not. Um, f
ully there to, to, um, to reach
our target becausewe haveuh dependencies on capacity in our teams.
W Wouter 10:27
How is prioritized solely based on business case or other factors as well.
W Wilco 10:34
In our team or for in other teams?
W Wouter 10:37
You know, so the team that has to execute and these, these initiatives.
W Wilco 10:43
Yeah, we havewe have business value, but you also have something
what we have to do in um in law.
W Wilco 10:50
For a sample last last year we had sustainability claimsfor the ACM.
W Wilco 10:57
So you have a capacity claim of a quarter that they are not doing
anything else than that.
W Wilco 11:03
So if I, if I, if I, if I need to grow, if I need to grow, yeah, I need to, to. To
get that capacity, but I can't do it because it's a must have from the
market. So yeah, I thinkwe need the capacity but are now dependence
of other teams and our own team to shorten the time to market and to
get a lot of morevalue out of our initiative and and and. Um.
W Wilco 11:29
Yeah, and, and the only thingwhat you get, I think that the the the
knowledge between the teams and theworld is changingvery fast, that
the gap is coming bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. So, um,
traditional marketing is not there, but Yeah, we have also looked at the
other teamsfor other profile right now in the team.
W Wilco 11:52
That's why I'm curious to workwith you to seewhat should be our mid
and long term plan. What skills andwhat people do we need to execute
that?
F Felix 12:01
Followingup on that, what our findings and recommendations make it
easier for you to put things higher on the prioritization list with other
teams. For example, if, ifwe, if one of our findings is, well, we Need
phosphors currently lacking a data driven way ofworkingwithin digital
skills that would also help for sure, yeah, what I really want, and I hope
you can help me, that we make skills or profile inventory about not only
for the execution, what we need for the in the long term, but also for the
daily business.
W Wilco 12:47
Ifwe see that 80% of our target is next year is digital.
W Wilco 12:53
Then we should have a culture to be data driven, andwe should have to
be a culture ofwe need to have a culture like tests.
W Wilco 13:03
It cannot be that CX or AB testing or weapon list are not in the team. It's,
it'sfor me, for my part not possible.
W Wilco 13:11
So it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, yeah, if you, if you have no, if you're not data
driven, you're never going to stop at AB test because you have no
insights. So it's, it's building, you need a building block. So, yeah. My
question is really that you can help me to to get that done and to to to
shakeuh the teams around to say, OK, guys, if you
want to make this
better becausewewant to have more insight and profiles. And last week
we had a year plan and I present the storyline ofwhat we are doing to go
everyone said, yes, yes. So I said, for example, wewant to, to, to sell
propositions in a digital way, but not only in the digital way, also in the, in
the offlineway, for example, on telemarket, we need, we need
information about profiles of customers, about households, about
personal interests and that combines. Can help us to score our
prospects and customers to our, um, how do you say that?
W Wilco 14:15
To our propositions to our products and scoring, yeah, it's a lead scoring
andwhat we can do is based on that we can steer internally theway of
how propositions come to the teams. So for example, now we have a
customer solution development team who say, OK, we have a customer
panel andwe think.
W Wilco 14:34
Time price, for example, that's a proposition for peoplewho have
charging station and get a discount on their electricity.
W Wilco 14:41
Uh, it's very interesting. Now, then we have something, some, not the
POwho can challenge that to say, OK. Acquisition and retention, do we
have profilesfor we think the proposition is very elephants, so it pushed
down. So we have a team we need the capacity there, and other team
build the proposition and I said, OK, we have to use it online and I
pushed it back at the end. So it is be better ifwe can push it back at the
front side.
W Wilco 15:08
So now I'm also the batman said no, I'm not going to do it, but I'm at the
end of the chain. So we can we just clarify this?
G Giovanna 15:18
You're talking about Nor's team, right, when it comes to solutions and
then pushing that forwardingwhere to fit. Then I think this is something
that we can maybe investigateuh tomorrow with the during the
interview with the during the interview, but my point is.
G Giovanna 15:38
What you're saying is that usually how it goes is a proposition is created
without a clear segmentation, and then you need to find the the ideal
segmentation to push this proposition forward.
W Wilco 15:51
They say for example, they do it with the cosmo panel, so we have an off
cosmo panel and it's made in the customer solution development, the
team of Yun and therefore the sustainable solutions like sun panels, heat
pumps, sun boiler or something like that. And they say, OK, wewant to
do it. Some, some introductions are OK because the mark introductions
is not about sales. It's about the market introduction and the first to
market it as a product. I understand that.
W Wilco 16:19
But yeah, for awareness to set up awareness to create create creates
otherwise it's what they say, OK, we have high price put it in your shop,
for example, in our sales panels. But ifwe don't know who has to to who
he has to offer, we have, we have, we have, we have several times that
he made propositions and come to sals.
W Wilco 16:42
And it comes to that we don't have profiles, and if you have profiles, we
can look at what thevolume is so we can build our own business case.
W Wilco 16:51
So the, the, the, the question is, ifwework more data driven, we are
more invested in profiling. Then we can push back all the then we can
say to for example CSD, the team of, we need this instead of you have to
do this.
W Wilco 17:07
You've got to change it and turn it around. So that's the case Iwant to
make to that the teams are not everythingwhat's coming from top to
down. We have to push it.
W Wilco 17:18
We have some people in the teams who can do the right conversation,
so everything is coming down and everyone's come to the team. And I
have a challenge that I'm only the Batman and say at the end of the
chain, no, we're not going to do this. So we need people at the front of
the change that know we have to do this to ask the right questions to
the peoplewho make the propositions and the problems.
G Giovanna 17:37
And andwhy do you think that of course that there is a clear reason.
And a root causewhich is teams not being data driven, therefore not
having the right insights to create those propositions. But where do you
think this comesfrom? Is it, arewe, arewe saying then that this is, uh,
that the propositions are built on top of assumptions, so they're not
really built on top of needs or market changes it, is it only built from a
vision point ofview, um. Where, where are they coming from andwhere
is this gap then being created?
W Wilco 18:15
OK, what, what I think is that I think it's good you see it also in the city,
wewant to invest in heat pumps and charging states. But when you
can't, when I ask some questions about, OK, guys with a heat pump, and
you say, OK, what are the requirementsfor peoplewhen people can
have a heat pump, all of the requirements are not within the target. So
for example, ifwe say in 20301, 1out of 30,000people has a heat pump.
But, but, but not it's there, andwhat I know is not peoplewith higher. We
cannot sell it to peoplewho have not the right skills in the house. They
have not the peoplewho have not the financial or not the money to buy
the solution, so. Your your volume is, is, is decreasing. So, and also with
charging points, what we sell right now, we sell charging points to
consumers.
W Wilco 19:03
But when I say, OK, when I look in the market, 80% of the charge points
are private lease or are lease charging stage because peoplewill have
leased cars. So is it not better that you go to uhKia or Audi and say
when people sell a car, Also sell the charger because you are there in
the moment instead of people are looking for a lapa on Google, for
example, andwe put them in a form. So it's about, yeah, it's, it's about
thinking and about specs and about, and if, if you think about that, so
data-driven. I think yeah, we're not so busy withwith every proposition,
but only with the propositions who help the customers who can match
on the profile of the customer. OK, so I think that's why team are so busy
and capacity is very short of too low, that everything is pulling down,
everything's coming. There are no port how I say that in English. Yeah, I
know what you mean. Yeah, people asking the right question say, OK,
now if you have proposition, all 10come down, but you
want something
to say, OK, acquisition, retention. Do you need a proposition from a
customer profile? Yeah, we need it. OK. Iwant 13and 5, and the other
ones, whoop, away with it. So you have more capacity in the teams.
There's more focus, um, OK.
R Raban 20:31
if I may, uh, that's basically this ID, right, you're talking now about.
R Raban 20:37
The sharing a slide on the on the screen. Yeah.
R Raban 20:41
This is now thevision, right, to move forward. Yeah.
G Giovanna20:45
But uh do you think this is gonna solve?
W Wilco 20:51
What I mentioned if that's what wewhat we learned from this slide is
that this slide is a double click.
G Giovanna20:59
So whenever we take those 8segments, strategic segments, um, the
idea is then now to boil down into these ones to understand for each one
of the segments what are the specificities andwhat are then the
solutions and the initiatives that need to be plugged into each one of
those. Is this what you're talking about?
G Giovanna21:21
Is this the level, the level of
understanding that we need to have for each
segment.
W Wilco 21:29
I don't know. I, I, I, I thinkwhat we, what we see in the strategy, what also
was presented in the kickoff is that weum I think, I think, I thinkwhat's in
the start not right is that teams with product targets. I think that's not so
good becausewhen you're thinking about households, it doesn't matter
if you're going to sell 100,000e-contracts, it's about bringingvalue to
the customer.
W Wilco 21:57
Andwe can push an ENG contract, but if he needs a song panel, yeah, it
doesn't work. So I thinkwhat you have to do is make, make for the long
term, um, uh, teams based on, on value and based on end to end
journeys, f
ull final teams and not teams which are based on product, but
otherwise you get. Yeah, you get, you get only peoplewho look into
commodity will look into solutions. Um, so I, I think it's a combination of
steering theKPIs, what are theKPIs, so you get some behavior and the
set up from the organizations also that if you not change that. Uh, and
we have not, uh, um, more people to ask, OK, um, What what's
important about this, what's less important, it gonna stays the same.
F Felix22:48
Yeah, a bit of a granular question regarding theseuh strategic
segments. How do, how do you see the translation of these segments to
uh digital acquisition channels? Because, uh, in most uh acquisition
cases you
want to Targets as broad as possible to get as many
prospects in as possible. How do you see like you have all these
different segments? Most of them have some form of overlap with each
other also in digital acquisition. Uh, how do you, um, how do you counter
this? How do you see this?
G Giovanna23:27
can we switch to the segment slide?
W Wilco 23:32
I think, I think FedEx, from this perspective, I thinkwhat we have to do is
based on that's why wewant to invest in lead management based on
being their higher rate of f
unnel.
W Wilco 23:44
We know that people have not uhuh don't want to sell there, but people
are looking for answers and advice and help. And I think, uh, increase
the, the potential of your reach on the top and based on that on specific
questions. nurture people to the right products and instead of that
understandwhen there is by intention or not and push them to the right
products. So ifwe know we have a combination ofwhat are the things
you can do from a technical part is your households and you know the
personal personal interest becausewe see a lot, for example, when
people are technically OK for dynamic pricing. O
b
viously, for example,
peoplewant to have to say, OK, I don't want every month other prices.
W Wilco 24:36
It's, it's um it's, it's not fitting each other. So you can say, OK, if personal
interest is something else, then what we see is technical, you can say,
OK, based on that, we need to understand, OK, whichwhich is the best.
F Felix24:50
Uh, that's, that's, that's something that you learn about, uh, the
prospective customer after they click on, uh, a specific ad. So
everything that's happening before the adwhere it's just, you know, uh,
a prospecting campaign, how do you see the integration of these. Um,
segments there. So, uh, would you integrate that into your, your
targeting or would you keep your, yeah. Yeah, and I think it's only I don't
know if you have an interview with Vinica she's the engagement
manager.
W Wilco 25:24
I think a lot of the things to nurture people to to. To come to get people
into consideration and to nurture them to to bio intention is a part of
engagement.
W Wilco 25:35
Um, um, and that is, um.
G Giovanna25:40
That is different than the preventing turn.
W Wilco 25:45
Yeah, yeah, is when people is a customer and engagement are more on
people high in the f
unnel.
G Giovanna25:54
OK, so that haven't, that has, um, that have signed, signed in maybe, but
haven't uh procured any any solutions yet.
W Wilco 26:04
No can do it on prospects, for example, we have now with the leaders
they say, OK, we have a topic that people say Iwant to have grip on my
energy costs. It has nothing to do with an energy contract. It has nothing
to do with solar panel also. Andwe know exactly what questions people
ask in that combination. So what we are going to do is to make content
in the channels to get connection based on the questions to potential
customers. We are scoring that based on interaction and based on that,
yeah, we say, OK, when we think someone has a buy intention, we can
handshake them to our salesfloor. Andwe have the right combination
between households, I don't know theword, can America and personal
interests, we know almost for sure. That the product isfitting to the
prospects. The only thing that can happen is that buying intention is not
100% there, but from a technical part, from a product part we are
matching the right combinations to to the profiles.
G Giovanna27:10
OK.
G Giovanna27:12
Can we move forward?
G Giovanna27:16
Yeah.
G Giovanna27:18
When, um, when we think about, uh, specifically the, the acquisition
strategy, um, can you sharewithus things that have been done in the
past or the latest initiatives? What are the main efforts that are now
um
in place? And uhwhat is your take on this, like, what are the successf
ul
ones, what are the ones that were discontinue that weren't working?
Can you tell us a bit about this experience?
W Wilco 27:54
Uh, from our own team, from what we're doing, or for, for the total, um.
W Wilco 28:01
I thinkwhat wewhat we did. In the past it has pushed deals to people.
Andwhat we are doing andwhat we're doing is based on teams. So for
example, when it is uh Santa Claus, Christmas or based on that, we have
some other deals.
W Wilco 28:21
So we know, for example, when we come into the December month, we
boost more deals with premiums. For example, switches or something
like that becausewe know it works very, very good.
W Wilco 28:32
Um, what we also do is that we know in our flows, uh, based on, uh,
postal codes which connection people have, or do they have a duo or
signal, andwe push them uh dealsfor specific for that people, but the
but the but the Yeah, I think that the old marketingwhat we did andwhat
we're going to change now is that we not push everything to a sales will
come from a channel. So so for example, if people are looking at pages
to say, OK, Iwant to, uh, energy comparing, for example, we send
people to an energy comparison page and then we have some dealsfor
them. Um, andwe're now making the switch to knowing more from the
people. So what we see is that the problem with that is, is that, um, um,
we're lagging conversion there becausewe don't know who is in front of
us. So that was the oldway of marketing. So. Churchvolume, social
display, bannering, setting deals to that, and it can be, for example,
energy, it can be, for example, power with a cash back, it can be.
W Wilco 29:42
Other deals and push them to the floor and hopef
ully they will convert. It
was all theway. And now we're going to change, uh, andwhat works,
what, what you also ask is, I thinkwhat works is push campaigns into
teams, uh, in the year. So for example, when we know, uh, uh, in the first
monthwe had, uh, uh, things to do with, uh, to do things with gardening,
for example, you know, people are there for, for, uh, in the December
month, we do things with premiums becausewe know, uh, uh, it's it's
Santa Claus. So we did in the past a lot of combination based on push in
the channels, based on teams during the year.
W Wilco 30:24
Um, so we know we know overall general behavioral, um.
G Giovanna 30:30
Patterns throughout the year, but we cannot go one level deeper into the
specifics to which product to reach to to each segment uh and to each
specific behavioral profile. That's what we're saying.
W Wilco 30:48
No becausewhat we also say from that that you have more focus you
want to grow the base, we have to focus on the amount of contracts.
And other players in the USwe have someMV targets, so we need less
contracts with morevalue per contract. So that's another setup on how
do you going to start with your campaigning. So I think that's also
different from what do you
want amount of contract as high as possible,
increase the base.
W Wilco 31:19
Or do wewant as much as value from per contract?
G Giovanna 31:25
because if you look at the scope of this project, we're talking about
volume here, right? So we're talking about attracting 100to 150in two
years, which is quite aggressive, um, so we're really talking about uh
quantity over quality, right?
W Wilco 31:45
Yeah, but what I say is not what's in the project but what's internally
change something.
W Wilco 31:53
Sometimes it's volume, sometimes it's value, yeah, yeah, yeah. So and
what you also see is when we say, OK, then then you get the the
problem that when we have proposition we convert better but have a
lower value, we cannot push that. Do you understand?
W Wilco 32:12
So, yeah, I think that's that's that's that's that's difficult, but so so that
that was the oldway to push deals. Based on Uh, volume. So for
example, when we have premiums, we push premiums pushing for a big
group, for example, iPads or uhuh a Nintendo Switch, for example, and
not specifically for some groups, for example, an air fryer or something
like that.
W Wilco 32:41
Um, and now what we now see is that when we push people to some
deals. Um, that a lot of peoplewe push to reduces cannot have that
proposition because they're not, for example, for a dual f
uel. So all the
deals we havewith premiums andwith discounts are dual f
uel. So for
peoplewho also have electricity and gas, we have no discounts and no
premiumsfor specific peoplewith elec electricity or only gas. Because
from avalue perspectivewe can't handle that because it doesn't that
much it doesn't that much, but I thinkwhat we know right now withwith
peoplewith highusage, I think you can do that we can do that because
we have morevolume. So but what we see in the in the and that's also a
changewe madewith the team is that we invest in data connections. So
in data from what we know
from households. So what we see for right
now is, for example, in an EO campaign wherewe push people from
page to social display affiliates to, to, to let them convert, is that they
see that 20% of the peoplewho came into that into that page cannot
convert because they are a singleuser.
W Wilco 33:57
Yeah, they only haveuh electricity. So in the oldway we think, hey, N is
not working, conversion rate is lower, we need another deal, but the
problem is that we bring people to that pagewho cannot convert
because they have not the right connection.
W Wilco 34:11
So now we know postal code, we say, OK, based on your postal code,
we see right now that only electricity and gasses on your postal code. Is
that right? Yes. And then we reconnect them to another flow to bring
them to only electricity contracts or only gas contracts. So we see a
high increase in conversion.
F Felix 34:29
What that also I, uh, I, we, we took a look at theum the documents that
you sent us, and, uh, one of the documents uh pertaining to the online
salesf
unnel also said that uh one of the biggest challenges is that
people coming, uh. Coming into the sites are really price sensitive and
that's wherewhere the drop off is, right, wherewhen they see the
photoel price, they, they tend to drop offwhat you say what you just
described, uh, would that also be a solution for that?
W Wilco 35:06
Uh, no, no, no, it's not about price, it's about, this is about deals. Uh,
that people not the problem is that they send everyone to the same deal,
but the problem is when you have in the in the new world peoplewithuh
with sustainable, so we have one connection only strong electricity,
some people have dual, and you push them only do a deal. If if you don't
know who's there, uh, conversion rates are dropping. So we now see
that in the oldway that 20% of the traffic is pushed from example for
paid search. There are peoplewho cannot use the proposition because
they they have no dual connection.
W Wilco 35:45
So it's not about the proposition, it's about the, the, the, the, they
become the discussion we hadwith the data driven, the households can
America, um, uh, that people can convert. So we have, we have to invest
more in that to understand if people can use the proposition from a
technical perspective.
W Wilco 36:08
Clear. So, and the problem, and the problem with the proposition is,
what, what you see is that we do with the Excel andwe made a f
unnel
step by step. So we have a target set with an online part and OK, we
need 5or 6% more conversion rate, that was the end of the track. So we
madeuh Documentation about how many people start to flow, how
many people come out to flow, and every step is are the dropouts there,
so we know exactly on which part of the flow we have to increase the
traffic to the next step. And, and, and I think at 22months or 3months,
we say, OK, we bring more people to the proposition, but they see no
more conversion.
W Wilco 36:48
Andwhat they see in theusability feedback is that other people, only
people, I think 45% of our um um I say that user, um.
W Wilco 37:00
In user, the, the, the, the, the information use is gay people say, OK, you
are muchum uhuhuh price comparsizes are much cheaper than you.
Uh, your competition is much cheaper than you. So then I make a case
and I go to the To the boss of Kabiawho are settingup prices and say,
OK, wewant to reach these goals. We have thisfeedback from our
customers or our potential customers our prospects. We're not going to
reach it. I need this to test andwhat we test to then is that we test the
price comparison proposition in the photo for salesflow. And the
conversion ratewas 40% higher.
W Wilco 37:47
40%. So, I thinkwe, yeah. So if you can say if you have that thewhole
year.
W Wilco 37:56
Proposition is, is really, is really important in this to increase conversion.
F Felix 38:03
So I think the right proposition for the right uhuh customer segments.
W Wilco 38:08
Yeah, andwhat they're doing for the next year is what we havewe have
we have data from our affiliate partner Perel, whichwill make a tool
which has insights in all the energy tariffs in thewhole markets the
whole year.
W Wilco 38:24
Andwe can compare it right now in real time to what our prices are, so
we know our price distance to competitors, andwe know
from an earlier
stage that if the price distance is more than, for example, 3or 4cents, it
lacks conversion. So what we're doing is we set alerts on when prices
have been compared more than 3or 4cents, giveus an alert. Yeah, and
for next year we make appointments with Cavio to say, OK, can we make
an appointment? Its distance is more than 4cents, we go to another
deal.
W Wilco 38:54
So we are more andwe are moreuh leading debt when you say go to
another deal, you mean drop this customer or uh because this uh this
person doesn't have a high propensity to convert. Now another deal
where the tariffs are not as high as 4cents becausewe know when it's
more than 34cents, then the conversion rates are dropping, so we need
to be in between deadlines. Yeah, OK.
G Giovanna 39:25
So we, so from what from what I understand, we're saying that there's a
very um avery significant dropout when it comes to deal when when the
the the price is not sensitive to the type of a segment, right? So this is a
big initiative for you guys to adjust price to the segments that are
entering the f
unnel.
W Wilco 39:51
I think, I think price is one, but also price is not for everyone interesting
becausewhat we see, we have a lot of segments and you can spoke to
toLefy or to to Anthony who can show
us. We make a lot of
combinations about users so low, me and high based on Alexia and gas,
but also if people have solar panels. Andwhat we know that in our flow, I
think.
W Wilco 40:14
50or 60% of peoplewho have solar panels are entering our flow. And
they have a different prices not only or always the Um, the trigger for
them to, to, to come to Voter.
W Wilco 40:32
Um, and you know the bag delivery cost or, uh, uh, uh, something like
that, um, when we, when we pay 12cents per kilowatt back from Voterfa
is also interesting for them. So based on that, we makewith a team of
Paul, we set up a CXO test penalty. So based on our segment, we've
seen an online flows with the, with the, with the. Uh, um, I say that, if
they have sound panels, if they have low
usage, highuse of gas, we put
that to, to, to Vinny. Based on that, we make a cosmo panel say to
people, we have, for example, solar panels, but also in the f
uture heat
heat pumps and charging stations. OK, what are your triggers when you
want to look to proposition?
W Wilco 41:15
And ifwe know that, we can build a proposition andwe can inject that in
specific settlements in our solo. So then it helps us to really understand
the customer. So I think not for everyone, price is the trigger is based on
your situation. So we have more insights in the situation andwe
understandwhat people are looking at, what situation andwhat are the
triggers, we can make better proposition to, to become a customer of
Vodafone.
G Giovanna 41:42
And ifwe look at this. This timeline of 1to 2years, what would you
evaluate as being the as should be our our focus, likewho shouldwe be
focused on attractingwhen it comes to this target that we have.
W Wilco 42:10
Mm Uh, I think, I think the, the, the, the challenge for there is not one
person.
W Wilco 42:20
So, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I, I, I, I think, I think it's, it's not only on uhum.
Management levels are a long down or maybe also the, the, the, the PO
from the acquisition team, Vinny, who's uhwho's one of the team
members of Paul.
W Wilco 42:41
And maybewhen we say OK, price setting is very important that we
need also John van der Mer who isfrom Cavio who help us with price
settings. I think I think I think it depends on the outcomes.
G Giovanna 42:53
I think I, I asked thewrong question. Um, what I mean is in terms of this
uh customer profiles. For us to meet the target, who shouldwe be
focusing on likewhich type of customer shouldwe be focusing on that, I
think I think the traditional homes because there's the biggest part yeah
and um.
W Wilco 43:21
Well, I think that's what, but what other uhuh criteria that could help us
be more specific into this?
G Giovanna 43:29
Because of coursewe're going for volume, right? So thereforewe need
to be focusing on the, yeah, but what I see is we can do it on every,
every bucket becausewhat they're doing are doing a sales or add some
question if people, for example, have the charge points so we can.
W Wilco 43:46
Label our data in which are thevolumes of its buckets, so.
W Wilco 43:50
The only thingwe have to know. Is what what we have for proposition is
for the specific group interesting.
W Wilco 44:00
So I think the problem is we cannot say, for example, from uh from
digital, we are going to set up a campaign andwe're only looking for
highe customers. How arewe going to do that? Becausewe don't know
users, we don't know if they have a heat pump, we don't know if a
charging stations because that are the requirements if people are high E.
But we know andwe have boost the traffic to our website andwe label
people for, do you have a charging station, and do you have, for
example, a heat pump. We know, OK, underneath. OK, that's a high
customer. So what we are going to do is label our traffic to, OK, for
example, when we have 1000people in a solo.
W Wilco 44:32
Based on requirements, we have200peoplewith IE andwe have 800
peoplewith traditional households. It doesn't matter. I has not to be the
biggest group. It's it's an additional group.
W Wilco 44:45
So to get the combination with the traditional households and people
would have IE. Which are peoplewith the charge station overheat pump.
It can also be something someonewith solar panels.
W Wilco 44:57
Helps us to whichwe have to focus on these groups.
W Wilco 45:02
First we have to know who's in front of
us. Do we have to trace our
house on? Yes. The other ones Peoplewith solar panels, we already
have that 60% of our people arewith solar panels. So that's also an
interesting group for us to be in the right proposition. And other people
will have EV point or we didn't know
becausewe didn't ask for the
information our products like that.
W Wilco 45:26
So I think to come back to your question, I thinkwhat we now know is we
have peoplewith solar panels andwe have peoplewith traditional
households. Andwe have to ask questions, for example, in traffic or in
lead and flows to understandwhich other peoplewe are, solutions you
mean they have, yeah, which are the solutions and then we can say, OK,
what we see in our solar phones we have. People are in, in, in a group.
So what you're saying is that estimation in terms of these are not
accurate becausewe actually don't know. It's it's not mine. I thinkwhat
you see the They say we focus on customers with highuse, but I think if
we only focus on highusers, we're not going to double our online sales.
That volume is, is too low.
G Giovanna 46:26
OK, clear.
F Felix 46:27
So um so you said that uh the approach for acquisition is, is volume-
based, right? Um, I, I'm just um trying to understand like how the
marketing campaigns or digital marketing campaigns right now are set
up. Is it, is it like Uh, for example, broad Arctic, so get as many people in
the salesflow and then, uh, ask them, uh, once they're on thewebsite,
what their, uh, uh, uh, uh, focus is when it comes to solutions. So, uh,
are, are, do you have solar panels, do you have, um, uh, a heat pump,
etc. But everything that happens before the click is just broad, right?
Just, yeah, andwhat we do is wewe fill the customers.
W Wilco 47:17
Something like that andwe do retargeting based and if people are
coming in the flow and not converting, we retarget them, but what you
say, labeling people is done in the in the becausewe cannot see that
from a prospect perspective based, for example, on what they fill in in.
F Felix 47:37
Yeah, exactly, and, uh, not all, all of the targeting options on, uh, on
prospecting channels align with everything that you see here.
W Wilco 47:45
So when it, when it comes to, um, you know, having these customer
segments, these 8strategic segments that you see here, those are
pretty much only applicable.
F Felix 47:56
Everything that happens both click and pre-click, it's business as usual,
yeah, OK, then I f
ully understand and say, OK, whichwe have to I know
we have now what we have right in the flow are traditional households,
so.
W Wilco 48:15
Peoplewith ENG. Andwe are only going to invest with added adding
lead campaigns or adding integrated data connection. So for example,
Uh, ifwe integrate the model of DNA and then we say, OK, when people
have a highusage, we, we, we almost know that there are peoplewith
charging stations, we can seewhich of these buckets are there in our sal
slow.
W Wilco 48:41
Um, and based on that, when the thevolume is most high, that helps us
to reach our targets.
W Wilco 48:48
Yeah.
W Wilco 48:50
So, so, so, yeah, I think, I think from now at traditional households and
peoplewithuhwithwith home it's open, that's what we know right now,
andwewant peoplewith highusage for heat pumps and if he charges.
W Wilco 49:04
Well I thinkwhat we have to do is label in our current trafficwhich
people has that already and offer for them, especially proposition, for
example, discount on electricity because they know that heat pumps
use a lot of electricity. And um, so, so my approachwould be that.
F Felix 49:23
Is this something that you, uh, uh, when you use price comparison
websites that you can sort of label in in UTM codes, so this person uhuh
takes the box for um EV and uh heat pumps, so he sent to the buckets,
uh, uh, on, on the sites that handles the, the salesflow specifically for,
for those, for that segment.
W Wilco 49:48
You mean when people are on price comparison sites? Yeah, we don't,
we don't have data connection with price comparison sites. We only the
deals are on the site of the price. It's not an affiliated construction that
people make selection and then push it to us. The deals are making on
that with the networkwith affiliatewith that.
W Wilco 50:12
corporation that wewe for examplewe put a banner with a deal and
when they click on the banner they do the sale on our homepage, right,
OK, but in comparison, everything is happening in their in their
environment, they sort of gatekeep their own data.
F Felix 50:28
OK, but we really want to know, and they also want to know.
W Wilco 50:34
I know that only 6or 7% on the price comparison sites are converting.
They really want to know where the 93%. Of the traffic is going through.
Because I'm now in contact with Ben, Ben Baldwin from from Halich to
say, OK, can weuse Pixeling.
W Wilco 50:52
To understand for ours is also interesting because ifwe, ifwe, ifwe see
that a lot of price comparison, people are coming to our site and mostly
of our price comparison visitors. They may know why we need so uh
such as uh sharp er, yeah.
F Felix 51:10
Um, I, you, you mentioned pixeling, you mentioned a lot of other good
sounding initiatives, um. Is there a list somewhere of all of theseuh
initiatives that you that you that you'reworking on, um, yeah, I can share
with you. Yeah, that would be great, that would be great.
G Giovanna 51:32
Brilliant. OK, I think one of the one of the other things is scraping to get
all the, the household things based on postal codes.
W Wilco 51:44
And then we know if something has already, for example, a charging
station.
W Wilco 51:51
Um, it's also from a perspective that I'm it's also from a perspective.
When people are looking on Vinda, you can. Um, I don't know theword,
um, speller.
W Wilco 52:04
That someone is moving.
W Wilco 52:08
So yeah, I think more in depth, yeah, I thinkwhat really helps, I think next
year is to get moreum More profiling based on prospects and on
customers to know what they want.
W Wouter 52:23
And more creativeusage of external data sources then yeah so for
examplewe now have connection with Withwith the connection data if
people have dual or single connection, but also interestingwe saw also
peoplewho ask for a single but has a dual connection, so we can upto
gas.
W Wilco 52:43
For example, um, and it's also interesting for a customer for life people if
people are Coming to a single e propositions, they know also that they
have not the renewal the contact with the dual.
W Wilco 52:57
Um, so yeah, I thinkwe really and that's what I also see is is more
profiling, it's profile about, uh, uh, things in the household. Um, I think
we really, really need to invest in that, but it also helps with this, how
big
your buckets are, which bucket here is the biggest.
W Wilco 53:19
So, yeah, and this, that, that's very interesting, but not only from the
executive perspective, but I think also from um from a retention
perspective to do it with the customer profiles.
G Giovanna 53:30
I have one last question for you, Vilo. How is that because you
mentioned a lot of these propositions coming top down and you're
having to push them to the segments that are available to you. Uh, how
is this collaboration between what what is the type of data that you
collect and the profiling that you are able to To enrich and uh this uh
proposition development.
G Giovanna 53:56
How, how would you say is this um? Collaboration between the two
teams.
W Wilco 54:05
I thinkwe started This year we had conversations to to to to do more on
profiling and the first what we do and discuss in the air is that we have to
make a proposition matrix. So what we're doing is make a list of all our
propositions and all our services, for example, from charging stations to
smart smart charging for peoplewho have a charging station. What are
the I don't know thewords in Englishvery bad. Can America remarks. I
don't know.
W Wilco 54:37
Oh yeah, what are the characteristicsfrom the from the households
where you can have the proposition.
W Wilco 54:45
So when you
for dynamic food is interesting. I know you say what I get
now is cell dynamics, so I ask to who.
W Wouter 54:53
Peoplewith solar panels, right?
W Wilco 54:56
Yeah, but when I asked you also with solar panels you have 3different
segments. But for example, 60%with peoplewho have solar panels we
get from price compared sites are not peoplewho sell dynamic or
buying dynamic. They go for the lowest price. So within thewithin the
solar panels in the Berkeley, you have three different segments. People
have less sun panels and has NeO
usage. Peoplewere coming to zero.
So back delivery and users is 0and you have peoplewith more back
delivery than users. For each of the groups, there's a different
proposition, but I didn't know that. So we need a proposition matrix
based on household characteristics which proposition fits when.
G Giovanna 55:45
Also behaviors, yeah, yeah, yeah, in combination withum.
W Wilco 55:52
What do Iwant? I don't want to pay every month and another bill or I
want to be, uh, Iwant, yeah, some personal interests as we have
combined it, I thinkwith thewith the households. Yeah, brilliant, we're
gonna let you go.
G Giovanna 56:09
We have another one to attend to it for you? Yes, very much.
F Felix 56:16
If you could share that list of that roadmap of initiativewithus, that
would be great, yeah.
G Giovanna 56:22
We have, I thinkwe have one last question, please help me to also invest
in skill sets and peoplewe need to get this this way of thinking, way of
working this mindsets in this, otherwisewe can make a really nice plan,
but we cannot roll it out becausewe have not the right skills and not the
right people in place.
W Wilco 56:48
So please help me to also If that what you need from a perspective,
where your worker perspective and form the skills of the mindset
perspective to to to to make this work.
G Giovanna 56:57
Yeah, I think, yeah, for surewe can write down these recommendations.
I think if I am if I am clear with in terms of
um company um uh
reorganization and uh attraction of talents, this is a project on its own,
right? But in terms of recommendations, we can for sure drive and uh.
Um, point of direction on on improvements and things that should be
done to make sure that we reach that.
W Wilco 57:27
This is part of this is part of the liberal, right? The the the the setup and
organization skills, knowledge, something like that.
G Giovanna 57:34
Uh, not in detail. Uh, this is not part of the roadmap.
W Wilco 57:38
OK.
G Giovanna 57:38
It's, it's what is uhwhat is within the tactical roadmap that we need to
do, uh, but not in detail, but I think, uh, in terms of recommendations
and high-level recommendationsfor surewe can uhwe can add this to
the deliverables as well.
W Wilco 57:53
Yeah yeah brilliant.
G Giovanna 57:55
Uh, thank you so much for your time, Vilo. I thinkwe have some follow-
up questions, uh, becausewe covered only part of
uh part of the
questions, um, avery small part of the questions.
G Giovanna 58:07
But uhwe'll send you these follow-up questions if it's needed so we're
gonna evaluate and do the assessment again the list with current
initiatives and copy.
R Raban 58:29
I think I see it. OK, thank you. Thanks. Bye.










**Gijs (Strategy)**

R Raban 0:00
You a script that we prepared for this. Um, first question, um, yeah,
could you briefly share your journey so far info and uhwhat, what your
current role is?
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 0:09
Sure, so I started thought for a little bit over a year ago in the strategy
team for CNSunder Bund.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 0:18
So that means that the scope, I'm mostly on on the B2C side. I have
another colleaguewho does the B2B side of CNS, um, and since shortly
also the heat networks business of
uh football is part of that scope. Um,
I've done many different things. I mean, I think, uh, the most relevant for
this particular, uh, project is the review of the, the, the consumer market
strategy. So, um, again, the, the BTC market is comprises both SMEs,
small to medium enterprises and consumers, and this strategy that I
help to review isfocused on the consumer side of the business. I think
that's the most relevant for what you're looking at. Yeah, yeah, clear.
R Raban 1:11
Thanksfor elaborating shortly on that becausewe do not have too much
time moving on to the next question. Uh, I think this is made by you,
right, or at least your team, yeah, strategicvision of Fafa.

R Raban 1:26
Um, yeah, could you tell us a bit so it's clear what direction and and the
strategy team sees? Could you tell a bit on the opportunities that you
see in the solutions and home energy services domain, moving forward
for Faten fall?
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 1:39
Yeah, I think the the the energy surfaces is actually mostly, I mean, there
are opportunities, yes, but it's also mostly defensive. I think I think these
are services, especially when it comes to home energy management,
and as there are more solutions capital S as we define them within, so
that means that heat pumps, solar panels, charging stations, etc. as they
become morewidespread in consumer homes, being able to offer some
part of the energy sources, so some kinds of optimization based on
price. Comfort or other, other factors will be crucial in sort of retaining a
customer relationship as an energy supplier and therefore actually
mostly sort of a defensive natureversus the other participants in the
markets.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 2:34
And so that's that's kind of the energy services side. I think the solution
sidewewe expressed, you know, that's actually sort of installing
solutions is avery different type of
businessfrom the sort of core
strength of an energy supplier, so we also said that's a Value chain and
the sort of a an opportunity that wewant to uh pursuewith partners in
the business that includes Fea, which is part of football, but also other
other installation companies but should not be the primary focus of our
strategy here at and um. Um, but of coursewewant to make it attractive
for peoplewith set hardware to, uh, to choose Falal as an EMG supplier,
uh, through all manner of, of like smart propositions such as, uh, you
know, theuse, uh, contractsfor peoplewith an electricvehicle charger
that they can uh optimize the costs of charging their vehicle.
R Raban 3:43
Yeah, yeah, so there's a clear direction that you also then recognize in
the market and you are saying that photo needs to, to, to move along.
Um, what is your view on the role that photo could play in the, in the
home energy services domainal also more specifically about, uh, or
propositions that they could bring to the market.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 4:06
Yeah, so I think, you know, there are multiple types and I think you need
to sort of start with something that is rather close to home, something
that we already have some capabilities in. So I think theuh the home
charger is a good example, right? So we already have dynamic price
products, we haveuhuhwe have a different type of
use productsfor it
as well. With different time blocks that are priced to be optimal for
someonewho charges their car, so that's almost sort of like electricity
price contract setting.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 4:44
But on the other hand, you also would expect from an energy supplier
such asfossil f
uel to receive information on it for it to be properly. Uh,
included in your, in your energy usage reports you get every month or
that you can see in the app, uh, basically to show how opinfo is sort of
your energy partner in a broad sense of theword, and can that you can
turn to Volinfo for anything to do with your energy households, including
the solution that's connected to it and in this case, the charging station.
And I think theum home energy management as a It's potentially
extremely broad, right? You can, you can, there are all basically every
kind of electrical device in your home could theoretically be a part of a
home energy management system. But Falcons chosen explicitly to not
do that, you know, we are not a part like your partner when it comes to
smart lighting or whatever, but we are a logical partner when it comes to
the big energy consuming or energy generating or energy storing
products in your home. So that's what we call, I thinkwe call it the big
the big 5, so solar panels, heat pumps, uh. cooling and charging station,
and in the f
uture, potentially energy storage. So those are the only kind
of devices or kind of that wewould play a role in developing energy
servicesfor. So, you know, Google Home, whatever, they can turn on
your microwavewhenever you
with your app. That's not our, that's not
wherewe're going to be a logical partner for a consumer.
R Raban 6:31
So it's a time that you that you see far more as, as the, the, the central
player that and also the, the, the, the point of contact for the consumer
for their energy-related matters, um, and, and everything around the
homeuhuh domain, um, and that's all then helps the customer to make
the right decision to for the partners, uh. Uh, for, for example, uh, to
deliver the infrastructure, um, because photos basically sayingwe don't
go to do that ourselves, but we can be the linking pin, um, between the
consumer and all the energy needs they have.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 7:04
Yeah, except for the part everything around your home domain because
it's not, it's explicitly not everything, it's only sort of the big chunks,
exactly, yeah.
R Raban 7:14
Yeah, I thought Iwants to stick, stickwith that.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 7:16
Yeah, yes, yes.
R Raban 7:17
OK, Claire, thanks. Andwhat do you see as the biggest challenges right
now
um and and also coming years to execute this strategy?
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 7:27
Um, so I think, um, I think, I think data is a big challenge. So, you know,
you see here on the Y axis of this graph also, so, you know, the shift we
envision is also one to You know, if you
want to address these, these
consumer segments which are increasingly diverse in terms of their
behavior because of these, uh, because of these solutions, you need to
be able to recognize and track them throughout the organization, right?
So I think there's a big challenge internally in terms of data, um, um,
and, uh, yeah, and and having that digitally available for all the different
departments uh in auniform way. Um, And then I think, you know,
there's a lot of I think the more overarching challenge is that the
observation is you have all these different segments and some of them
are for now small but will grow strongly towards the f
uture, so it will be a
continuous balancing of. Dedicate resources to serving the sort of
traditional base, which is still the large majority of all the contracts in our
base currently, or do we dedicate resources to developing propositions,
making, you know, sort of tailoring our offering for these segments
which are emerging, so that's sort of, I think.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 8:49
You know, so you have avery practical one, the data one, and avery sort
of meta one, about how to allocate your resources, if you know the short
term challenges in terms of
base, which I'm sure you're you'rewell
aware of.
R Raban 9:04
Yes, yeah, right. Thanks, Claire, um, talking about the privatization and
wherewhere growth might happen, andwe also saw this overview. Um,
and, and yeah, could you explain a bit, um, uh, this graph and, and, and
also why mainly you think these shifts are happening like thisfor 44?
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 9:29
So, um, so this looks at the market as awhole, right?
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 9:33
Uh, and so you can see that the 8.3million households on the left, um.
So this is this is a shift that's just if you look at the market reports is
happening, right? People are installing more solar people even towards
the f
uture still. People are installing more heat pumps, even though it's
slightly less ambitious now with the new government because they
removed one of those instruments which forced the replacement of gas
boilers with heat. From 2026. So, uh, you know, but that's still going to
grow as our with EV charging is also expected to grow. So, um, these are
just trends that you see happening. um electrification trend is of course
encouraged by the government in various ways with subsidies because
it all in the end can contribute to a. To free energy system for as awhole,
um, and also makes economic sense, uh, in some cases more than
others.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 10:42
So for example, solar now still is very, very attractive for, for households
generally, um, that will change a bit from, from 27forwards after the
soldier is is removed, um. And yeah, and so this is the areawhere it's in
flux a little bit andvery dependent on government policy, how attractive
these solutions actually are, and therefore how quickly this uh transition
will will be realized. But the f
undamental trendwe believe is there, uh,
but it's a bit of a question of how, how quickly is it gonna go with the
new government especially.
R Raban 11:22
Exactly, yeah, clear, clear comment on that. Um, so, so you're saying this
is the, the, the market, uh, prediction, um, where for, for photo fall, and,
and you also talked about these big five, right? But for photo fall, do you
really see most growth, uh, in talking about these segments that we see
on this slide. So you have to mark it and then what photo can capture
from that. Um, what's your perspective there?
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 11:47
Yeah, so I think the, um, so we have a strategy, right, which is that that
wewant to achieve above fair share, so 1.5timesfair share in the high E
segments. So that means customers who have an EV charger or a heat
pump in their homes. That's wherewewant to be, right? And right now
we are and that's, you know, the strategy is. has given this, this, this task
to, to, to the organization to make sure that that happens, right?
Because right now we are actually performing slightly below
fair share in
those particular segments, um, andwe believe that with the
improvement of our propositions, etc. etc. we can get a better position
there. Um, so that's wherewe, wherewewant to be in terms of, uh, in
terms of growth, um, and I thinkwherewe'll see pressure is in this
traditional segment, um, because, well, they move from one bucket to
the next, right? So it's not um it's a kind of a It's a zero-sum game in that
sense that if they move to the solar buckets, that means they fall out of
our traditional energy home buckets. So that's that will beunder
pressurewill form a lower share of our base in the f
uture than currently.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 13:11
Currently it's a majority and so that it's like 6065% of our current base
does not have any solutions.
R Raban 13:18
Yeah, indeed, so, um, the, the expectation is that therewill be a big shift
uhup until 2030, like a like a complete transformation.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 13:27
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. I mean, that's uh because simply photo is is it
one of the top 3suppliers, so they are in to a large extent a reflection of
this market.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 13:40
Um, and, and yes, therewill be a shift, but you see there's 38% in the
blue in the middle there. That's still the biggest single segments, you
know, like there are multiple segments, but it's still the biggest single
segment will be traditional, but as it will be in the minority if you put
everythingwith the solution on the other side. So that's the 60, that's
the flip from 60/40to 4060.
R Raban 14:06
Exactly, yeah, yeah, um, yeah, to, to capitalize on these opportunities,
wewere, uh, wondering about strengths and, andweaknesses, uh, your
perspective on that, but since you're in the strategy team, we thought
maybe there's also a swauh, available, um, for the customer solutions,
uh, domain. Is that the case? So we could receive.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 14:28
Yeah, so we, uh, I personally am not a big fan of the SWOT framework.
So as Iwas in charge of this review, I did not make a SWOT framework.
They have existed in the past, so I mean if you, if you
want one. We can
give it, but I, yeah, we felt for this uhum review was not the most
appropriate framework, so no, it's a short answer. We don't have one.
R Raban 14:59
OK. And, and could you tell us a bit on, on the strengths and
weaknesses that you, that you see in the market?
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 15:06
Yeah, so it depends a little bit on how you define your competitive
space, right? So I thinkuh if you look, I think generally you can say that
the differencewas, um, you know, if you try to look for a sort of
competitive advantage that we havewith, with an AO and ascent, so
that's the big three, it's not that big. Um um they do many of the things
that we do. I think one of the The key differences therewith them is the
fact that we have a much larger portfolio of renewable assets ourselves,
right? So in that sense, we are more of an integrated energy player than
than they are to the extent that that. Translates to actually tangible
competitive advantages, you know, that that's, that's a bit more of a
question. Um, in the f
uture, it might give you a slightly lower price on
your um certificates of origin, so on, on making sure your electricity
portfolio is green and sure you remain asset access to that. um but yes,
so that's one of the difference, if not a strong source of competitive
advantage, I think.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 16:23
I think the, the, the advantages versus the rest of the market versus the
um the sort of the more the newcomers, the disruptors is that um uh
Fofo has enormous experience in um in in knowledge of the all the
different energy markets, um, and they have their own uh trading
division which optimizes everything. Uh, and, you know, from Hamburg,
uh, across multiple European markets, so our trading capability and our
knowledge and access to these energy markets is, is, is, is, is a sort of
competitive advantage. It's especially the case, um, likewhat does that
mean? That means that um If you're looking to get morevalue out of like
an ENG contracts with a customer, it helps to unlock, for example, the
value in the imbalance market in portfolio balancing in in the f
uture,
perhaps in congestion management, you know, there are things, trials
that are being run now with the With thewith thewith the DSOs in the
Netherlands, so like theunder and etc.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 17:41
um, wherewe help them manage net congestion in exchange for some
kind of fee, um, which, you know, yeah, so that gives you the room to
operate to squeeze a bit more from, from uh regular commodity
contracts than what a smaller player would be able to do.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 18:04
Um, I think aweakness, maybe one a good one to mention, I think, uh, is,
is the sort of the digital competence of of f
ucking fall as awhole. So I
think I, I mentioned the, the.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 18:19
Uh, the data challenge just before, um, I think in general, the
competencies that will be demanded from an energy supplier in 2030
are to a large extent, like far more difficult than they wereuh like 10
years ago, and I thinkwhat is a bit, has been a bit slow in making that.
Um, transition, there are, you know, if you look at the layers like as I'm
sure you have like a dibber or whatever, sort of these more digital
natives, yeah, their app is, is, is better, they're sort of their um their older
digital infrastructure is undoubtedly a bit more agile and and f
utureproof
than than ours. So I think that that's somethingwhere has to make, uh,
yeah, has to make steps to.
R Raban 19:12
Yeah, there, and, and so you're talking about in the clear strengths that
you see also compared to uh to the, the traditional ones and the, and the
new entrance. And how do, how do you see this evolve, uh, moving
forward, say in the next 5years, um, to, to keep a competitive edge for?
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 19:32
Um, Yeah, I mean, that's, that is to a large extent the result of our own
strategy, right, and how effectivewe are in implementing that. I think
we've said uh energy services are a cornerstone of our of our consumer
strategy. Well, ifwe manage to uh yeah, to capitalize on that to.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 19:55
You make steps, make the required steps, then that source of
competitive disadvantage disappears in the f
uture. um, so I think, uh.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 20:06
Yeah, I think it is a result of our strategy. I don't think there's anything.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 20:12
Like I think there's nothing f
undamentally like really major changing in
the next 5years in terms ofwhat is asked of the energy suppliers, other
than the challenges that we've already identified. So, yeah, OK.
R Raban 20:28
OK, um, talking about, um, um, threats or maybe also trends in the
domain of the policy in the Netherlands, you
were also mentioning this
already, but this is super important.
R Raban 20:40
Um, what do you see currently shifting also with the new, new
government that impacts strategy on the shorter term.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 20:50
Yes, I think the.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 20:52
Uh, just the, the heat pump one is avery clear example, right, where in
2026, I don't know if you're aware that it used to be that if your your gas
boiler had to be replaced, it had to bewith a hybrid heat pump. So that
is the fact that they've scrapped that obligation means that this
transition. whichwe have on the screen in front of
us, it's going to be
slightly slower than uh than than originally anticipated.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 21:23
Um, so that's a clear example. I think in a broad sense, we don't know
that much about the specific measures that the government will actually
undertake, but um. In the broad sense is that therewill be less support
for the energy transition and more focus on the affordability of the
energy bill. Um, we think that's a bit silly because the two are
connected, but um it's uh yeah, that means that that's That the impulse
to make, to make this transition happen is going to be slightly less
strong in coming years, yeah, slower, yeah, yeah, exactly.
R Raban 22:01
OK, um, back, back again to this graph for for one more question. So,
um, uh, our objective, uh, with Yolanda as our key key sponsor is to
attract 150K extra customers over the next two years. Yeah, this is of
course a projection up until 2030. Um, within the two years, where do
you think like that the most opportunities are, uh, to, to increase the
acquisition and increase the performance there, uh, to, to reach that
goal for us.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 22:33
Yeah, it's a good question, and the one that we have sort of internally
debated a bit because it's the curve of, you know, the adoption curve of
all these solutions is a bit skewed towards the end of 2030, um, so that
means that some of these segments are still very small this year and
next year, um. So where that's not the case, so if you're really looking at
the base stabilization based growth, um, you have to look at these the
two biggest segments, so the traditional energy homes, so the thing in
blue here, and I think especially those Uh, wherewe know that they
could bewilling and able to, uh, to transition to one of those other
buckets in the f
uture. So, that means homeowners, right, are more likely
to invest in this transition than peoplewho rent.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 23:28
Um, you know, and there are certain types of
buildings and areas that
are more likely to want to make this, to be able to make this transition.
So that should be a focus point, I think, because that's still avery sizable
part of the market, so in terms of
base still usef
ul. Uh, and the second
one is, is actually solar. Um, and, um, because solar, you know, if you
look at our strategy is to get heat pump owners and uh EV charger
owners, but 70to 80% of those people have solar. So it's a bit, you need
to think about uhuh how we can help customers. Makeuse, make more
effectiveuse of their solar generation, and that's going to help us
achieve our ultimate goal of getting those high electricity customers in
the base in the f
uture, and that's already now a significant chunk of the
market, so it will also help with the base stabilization.
R Raban 24:27
Yeah. OK.
R Raban 24:29
Um, see, we have2minutes left. OnGO quickly uh checkingwith you if
there are any.
R Raban 24:35
Questionsfrom your side at this point?
R Raban 24:42
Why I have a final question.
R Raban 24:46
You're good. OK. Yeah, so, um, yeah, so we, we're just stepping into this
company, uh, to do this project, uh, so wewere really wondering, um, is
there any advice from your side, um, at this point, how we can be
successf
ul, uh, knowing that we have this objective that was shared by
GeO in the beginning.
R Raban 25:07
Of the meeting because you, I think know the father of our context quite
well.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 25:12
Um Yeah, I thinkum.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 25:18
You know, I think it's It's, it's important to get Yolanda on board as your
as your as your as your sponsor, um but I think it also extends a little bit
beyond uh just Yolanda's department because I thinkwhere I see, I see
sometimes things slowing down and implementation is because a little
bit siloed in these different departments ofwhichMCO is the one that
you're officially sort ofworking for, but other parts, other departments
play a big role in actually making this stu
ff happen.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 25:58
So I think that would be maybe some advice is and that's maybe for.
something for you to discuss with Yolanda as well is uh how are you
including at least theum the the directors of these different
departments in the process as awhole and also in sharing and
supporting your conclusion because if that's, if they don't support it,
then Iloda is gonna have a hard time implementing it. So, um, um, I think
that would be. There therewould be some advice. Um, it's a big
company, so it's quite a bit, uh, as a, as a consultant myself, uh, it's, um,
the stakeholder management, uh, dimension of this is, uh, is important,
more important than.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 26:46
for some other companies, yeah, yeah, thanks.
R Raban 26:49
That's really
valuable advice. Um, we're out of time. Thanks a lot, guys,
and moving forward, uh, yeah, we have a process, of course, coming,
coming2months. Therewill also be some sharing out sessions of our
progress and I think herewe are inviting guys as well for that, right. so
you can if you if you have time, you can attend and maybe give some
feedback, etc.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 27:11
Yeah, yeah, thanks guys. I think I've declined most of them because of
theuhum yeah, just commitments with other projects, but I am
definitely interested in the progress and if Iwant if I'm not there myself,
I'm surewill relay it to me and.
R Raban 27:27
Yeah, sharing, we agreedwith him indeed and he also said that he's
being more than you like in this project, yeah, yeah, exactly, that's to
reserve your time for other things. Um, thanks guys enjoy the lunch and
yeah, that's.
G- Gijs - Strategist at Vattenfall 27:45
Yes, yes, good luck guys.
R Raban 27:47
Alright, thank you. Bye.






**Paul Dwarshuis**
Super.
Raban
Yes, then we will start. Yes. Yes, we want to stop for a moment first. Yes, in your role and
your journey so far within Vattenval. So. What does he look like so far? I saw that you
worked at Vattenf for more than five years. Yes, what were the highlights of that?
Paul Dwarshuis
I just started on the first of November. November 1, five years. Yes. So I'm actually if you
look at the whole team that you work with. There I am thinking quickly with your now kit in
block, so to speak. And also really worked in other sectors. So also at ABN AMRO, in a
banking world before that two years at inco too. Yes. And do you want to know if we have
the ILO Lights the same?
Raban
Yes. Perhaps the most important one. Maybe Cherry
Paul Dwarshuis
I think equally important. Because it is sometimes a little diffuse. It has grown a bit
organically over the years. I was hired at the And what do you call that? Personal sales
channels, Personal sales channels. So that was at that time that was door-to-door
telemarketing. And external sales partners and new partnerships. Yes. So Albert Heijn,
Blokker are now looking at what we do with that. But those kinds of partnerships, but also
the partners, external sales partners and the fatal Salesforce. Would you like to know more
about what that is? Whether that is put together?
Raban
I like it, for sure, yes. Eh Silsdors
Paul Dwarshuis
is the Field Marketing Club. And that means physical face-to-face. At the door, high traffic
locations, and trade fairs, that kind of thing. I'll tell you what we do, but actually ninety
percent is doorte door. And the other ten percent are high traffic locations. Or a fair for
which we have the Huishoudbeurs. Yes. For example. And that is at a number of locations
in the Netherlands. Weesp, Zwolle, Arnhem. Breda. Yes. And from there, both the
consumer market and the SME market are served. Yes. Consumer market, that is really
agents, short, fast contacts, closing contracts. KZM is more of an account management
account management model. Yes. You can see that when I started. I hope there is no
causal link. but there were one hundred and eighteen zero Sils on one hundred and
eighteen. And we have now dropped below twenty zero Yes. Well, of course that was also
the question in that shill when we started with you. So then you also know a bit of the order
of magnitude. And how that went. And to continue the role for a while. Actually, I got into
the acquisition team there pretty quickly. Jolanda assigned that to me a bit, I call it. And
then acquisition marketing. By now, you have discovered that we are a yes, like any
commodity provider. Of course a marketing. or have an acquisition in a retention side. And
a new product side of course. And so I'm actually responsible for acquisition and marketing
on the acquisition side these days. Yes. Yes. So bringing in customers and marking makes
propositions the joke. On that side, that a team of ten people with database marketers,
content marketers, and regular marketers in it. Yes.
Raban
Yes. And that is still the case, both digitally and physically. the scoop of it.
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes. Yes. Yes, that's right, that's right. Yes, and there I come into the tangent with Yes, we're
not wrong, but there comes that's just tangent with Wilco. Yes. Wilco is actually a provider
to my team. Mi of digital knowledge, of digital Yes, well, the infrastructure, sales flow, that
kind of thing. That comes in nicely in that. I always call it two factories, the preservation
factory and the acquisition factory. Precise. Those are the two program teams and
everything is actually produced in them. Yes. what we come up with. We don't have any
other people who can do it. Yes, a number of support departments, of course. But if you
look purely for marketing sales, then in those two teams it has to happen there regardless
of a new product development.
Raban
Yes. Yes. Yes. And what do you think are the main causes that make that acquisition so
much. that there is a downward trend. It's natural that that physical acquisition is
decreasing. It will be more difficult. And digital does not know how to replace that well.
Until now. Yes, that is, yes.
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes it is.
Raban
Yes. Can you tell us something about how you see that?
Paul Dwarshuis
Well, Dirk, there are a number of things that have come our way. When I was just starting
out. So what we also have my working life contains a bit parallel to the downturn I just said.
We started with two years of Covid. Which of course has a severe impact, especially on the
physical channel. And as a result, we were simply not allowed to go door to door for six to
nine months in those two years because of the covid restrictions. So of course that
immediately had a big impact. What you then see is that consumers actually learn forced.
to orient the energy market in a different way. Because at that time, energy contracts were
still being sold. So people went online to find out what was best for them. While before that
time they just got advice at the door. and were just sensitive to a good offer. And if as long
as the monthly amount was lower, then it was soon fine. And so that is of course a very big
thing that has a lot of impact. And reputation. The canal has suffered a lot of reputational
damage over the years. When I worked in five days or five weeks, we immediately had a raid
from the HCM. who controlled the entire door-to-door channel of ours. are hoo well cut
out. But there is a lot of consumer irritation is not only caused by telecom and energy. But
they are the most aggressive sectors. Where also a lot of dubious intermediaries are also
inactive. So. Anyway, if you look, purely look at contact, for example, that charities and
lottery and the like. are at the door much more often than Energieinter. Anyway, that
doesn't matter. In the end, you have to deal with what the perception is. And the perception
is that it is a dubious channel. Of course, a lot of bad things have happened. And So I think
those are actually the two change consumer behavior and reputation that just put a lot of
pressure on that channel. And there it has come from, of course, after the past two years
many laws, traditional laws and regulations. which has now determined, for example. that
you are no longer allowed to conclude the contract in the first sales conversation. There
must be the minimum time in between. This creates enormous conversion pressure on
those channels. Yes. As a result, on balance, the number of contracts is actually
decreasing. But also. And I think that's what the legislation is all about. the business
models become negative for these types of channels. Just can't stand out anymore No.
Speaker: spk_2
That is the difference between gross and net contracts. What do you say? That's the
difference, I believe, between gross and net contracts. that I saw in the online sales
performance. the I
Paul Dwarshuis
don't quite understand what you mean.
Speaker: spk_2
Yes, I say in the file that they provided, the distinction was made between gross contract
and fake contract. And I think that was gross for the people who registered. Net was then
those who are not who did not cancel after fourteenth A.
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes it is. True. Yes. Yes. Yes, there are indeed cancellations there. So you can cancel for
different reasons of course. But you don't always know that, we ask. But that is indeed the
difference between gross net gross net compact. Yes. Yes. But the one who what I mean,
there is actually another step before that. Before it becomes gross. People who in the past
were actually concluded directly at the door. Ms of a good click was in a good offer. And
then a contract becomes gross at that time. The contract is not even concluded at all. So
that's why you're already converting. So because you can still manage that other thing. This
one, you can just go through through good rates. or by good aftales, afterc, aftales call. you
can manage those cancellations, I call it. So you can influence that. But that you can't even
get them in the groove at all. And that you don't even take out gross contracts. That is the
big problem at Deutche Bor. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, Telemarkting very briefly is a club in
Leeuwarden. An average of thirty forty agents who call there on outbound outbound
campaigns is what they call it. So then you have to think about winning customers who
look, where they have two weeks to think about it with us. is that also the case if they leave
us for a competitor. Yes. And in those two weeks you still have time to get them back. But
what you see there is that customers increasingly no longer want to be called. You have to
do that now. You are not allowed to conclude the contract immediately in the first meeting.
Well, the new rover. I don't know if that means anything to you. But in the past, you could
switch energy suppliers for seventy-five euros. And that has actually now become the
breakfunding. So as an energy supplier you can do it. Yes. The margin you lose on a
contract, I call it for a moment. The moment someone leaves early. Actually works a bit the
same as with the mortgages. . You can now charge for it. So that's with a new one-year
contract. Can you do that yes, often between five hundred and a thousand euros you can
charge as an energy lev. actually means that the churn is just less less, less high. So less
acquisition volume in the market as a result. Yes, we also suffer a lot from that with such a
telemarketing channel. Because that was normally very easy to call for seventy-five euros,
those fees. Then come over to us. So that causes much more switching behavior. Yes.
Raban
Yes. Yes. Interesting. Thanks. Paul for perspective stands in a relative. Yes. Top. We would
like to discuss this record with you. You see him on the screen.
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes. Top. I know him
Raban
even. Yes, No, definitely. I think this is one of the most famous slides at the moment in the
world. Yes, it
Paul Dwarshuis
is quite ambitious.
Speaker: spk_3
He is going to fall.
Raban
If you well. Yes. Yes, My question is of course our assignment is also about. What is going to
happen in that blue domain? What kind of propositions, what opportunities are there. And.
But also your view on it. We are curious about that. So if you think about acquisition. about
reaching new customer groups. and grow that way. What kind of opportunities do you see
in that column of solutions. And certainly also in Home Energy Services? What kind of
opportunities are there? What kind of possible new propositions or ideas Yes. Could add
value there for grasping traps. Also curious about what has already been researched. Could
you tell us more about that?
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes, definitely. I also try to go back two steps. To also tell a bit of the challenge in that. The
dilemma is of course always that we have to sell ENG. to finance that transition at all. So
the lady is now also a bit wider. He was first like: we really want to become a solution
partner. Yes, but we also have to sell ENG. to be able to play that role at all. And in the
beginning I focused on the sale of solutions. And but actually it is very fast, or not very fast,
it took a while. But we have also found out that the chimney cannot continue to smoke.
That is Those tens or a few hundred euros that you might be able to earn on such a solution
as an energy company is just totally out of proportion to your earnings that you have on
ENG. And then, of course, on the one hand, you have to think about what you find in the
consumer contract, or the business contract. But you also make a considerable margin on
your purchasing as energy companies. So they So that doesn't weigh against each other,
doesn't go up against each other. So after that, that has also been more in Sven's club. But
of course we think along with that and give input on it. Is of course very bad to look Where
can you still take your role, say as energy, your supplier. And do you want to avoid being up
to five figures behind but delivering EEGP. And that's what it came up with. And you also
notice that that demand is very much from customers. So to put more solutions in the
house. To have something you can manage this with, shall I say. And yes, and in the end you
see that coming back more and more. Is that ultimately a home energy management
system? where you eventually get your car, solar panels, heat boiler. maybe manage a
piece of the central heating heat pump. Yes, I think Achille still sees whether we are twofold
there or we are not a bit late there. I have already said about them in such a workshop. Yes,
why are we going to develop all that? Shouldn't you just buy that? Yes. So that's one and
two. Yes, in the end that is what is true is that where the relationship ultimately revolves.
Supposedly, you can also claim ownership with that. But yes, that is the reason that turns
out to be of course.
Speaker: spk_2
And Paul, such a home energy service. That would be a recurring reing stream, wouldn't it?
So that is an amount that is paid per month. To be able to manage your house, to be able to
manage the energy.
Paul Dwarshuis
That's a model, yes, to work it that way. Yes. Yes. Or you have to be able to build it in such a
way that there is not a monthly revenue stream on it. but that you make the benefits with
regard to balancing your EEG so great. that no one else wants to be at Vatco. No AV.
Speaker: spk_3
Yes. Looking at the scoop of this project. because of course we have the goal of one
hundred to one hundred and fifty K new customers. See your ideals within two years. Of
course, we also indicated Yes, well, at least we have that we are going in the right direction.
Of course, this is also a story of the future. Do you see within the scope of this project that
those solutions and those home Energy Services would become part of it? If only they
would be a perk on those contracts that are sold. Would that be additional or how do you
see that? Yes, like that
Paul Dwarshuis
funny. I happened to say it to Giovanna this morning. Just had an update on how to run. she
briefly told that she or you or she had spoken to Sven. He had said a lot about solutions,
that's it. And then I happened to nuance this morning. I said Yes, but I think that's just a bit
less relevant to our timeline. Look, I wouldn't rule them out one hundred percent either.
Because of course you can. It can be a hook to bring in to people or prospect. And. But I
think the horizon we have set, two years. And that that is not yet impact enough, is
impactful enough to really acquire. So that people say Wow, what was it really now that
him, we really need to go there. Or it now has the heat pump. There I think it will be more a
part of possible attraction and retention. than that it is really the one they are really going to
come to
Speaker: spk_3
. I was curious. It struck me very much that those contracts with those dynamic contracts.
That that is quite a growth market. That it doubled is at least a number of people. And that
Vat does not really have much or not much market share in that segment yet. Yes. Are those
interesting contracts for Vattenfallen to sell or not necessarily.
Paul Dwarshuis
Let me turn it around. If we would only sell a dynamic contract. Then we have to move into
a small building very quickly. Okay. So No, the values we generate with that. And I think that
is also the dilemma we are in now. And the values we generate with this are a lot lower than
on variable and fixed price contracts. And Remco could illustrate that if you really want to
know that specifically. And so we have always been a bit too womanly about it. We also had
real sales instructions reactive first, huh. So we only when we had the idea of Well, we
really don't bring it in without flexible. or a customer will really leave if we don't offer flex.
where we are now a bit more proactive in this. But of course you also see in our
communication. That that is not congruent, that image. so we don't actually buy eh yes,
very few flexes. And we are not associated with it either. We're kind of getting into that
branding engagement piece here. The flex is simply associated with new parties in the
market. And not with the existing parties. Then you immediately think of A and B of Van den
Brom. Those kinds of parties are more a bit the, the pioneers in the market are often
associated with flex and we are not.
Speaker: spk_3
This is not necessarily a good opportunity. What do you say? You don't see it as an
interesting market for you to grow up in. Yes, definitely. To a certain extent.
Paul Dwarshuis
Sure. Yes. Yes. Yes, but if it goes too fast, then we go. Yes, then we get slowly but as the best
model it will tilt a bit, I think. But it is. No, it's estimated. Well, at the moment five to ten
percent of the market. And I think it will go a bit further. Grow. As soon as people know what
it can all mean. I think if you add even more a number of solutions will of course increase.
Precise. If you start coordinating with each other, such a flex contract will also become
increasingly relevant. So yes, that is really going to grow. So we have to go along with that, I
think. Yes.
Speaker: spk_2
For example, they could be a kind of tip of the spear strategy. That you bring them in with a
flex contract. And that you then expand to a solution or a home Energy service.
Paul Dwarshuis
Sure. For a certain group, certainly. Yes, yes. Yes. Yes. But we still see. And that also has a
bit to do with risk perception generations. that not everyone is waiting for such a flash
contract. My mother is never going to do it, for example. So they just opt for variable fixed
contracts. So since that is, of course it goes slowly over time it will grow. People who are a
bit digital savvy. They will be able to follow all that well in the app. They feel comfortable
with. But you still have a very large group who look at it ONCE a year and then get rid of it.
Yes. Yes, it's still fifty to sixty percent of the market. V fixed price. So that. Yes, then you
come back into the corner of the Yes, personalization out of course eventually. The
segmentation.
Speaker: spk_3
Yes, I think that's an interesting one of course from this picture. The ambition is to move
more from general to more targeting. What. What is currently standing in the way of you
doing that? Because of course it is yes. In the marketing world, of course, that has been an
ambition for a long time.
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes, but I do hope you would ask this one. Because it really is the easiest question then.
Yes. The data data
Speaker: spk_3
is the answer.
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes, we just don't invest. And in it. That is. So we have youngsters in different areas, for this
you need pro profiles. That you know that someone has a roof on the south who doesn't
have a car. Well, go on, you understand. And so that's just whole. That is simply crucial.
And I have the idea that we still don't fully realize that or. Yes, sounds a bit silly perhaps. But
it often has to be a bit free to catch up, this kind of thing. So we have invested quite a bit in
that engine. That's probably already good. Yes. Yes, since I've been working there, that's
actually almost the only real big million-dollar project. And. But then we fail to invest really
well heavily in basically what I already say, just very sensing data. So make sure you know
who your customers are, prospect is of course a bit more difficult. late. So you also channel
it.
Speaker: spk_3
And to ask about it anyway. Yes, okay. So why is there no investment in it? Is the business
case not clear? Is there no support for continuing with that?
Paul Dwarshuis
Well, I think a Yes, a bit of vision, I think. If you have vision and guts, if I have to be honest.
So it really is what I have sounded the alarm very often. about the pros and laws regulation
of opt. So it's still difficult to get in touch with customers and prospects. And it will be even
more difficult next year. Because next year a bill will now be in the House of
Representatives. Because you are no longer even allowed to approach your own customers
for commercial expressions. Unless you have an opin. Yes, then I think a mega project Hup
with the opt-out. That could now slowly go up. But if you don't do it, then you can media
next year. It will probably become faithful six months later. But next year you just won't be
allowed to media your own customer anymore. Then I think Yes, that's your lifeline
approximately. Yes. Yes, I find it difficult to interpret. But I can observe that in the end it is in
too little priority. and also have the guts to go full steam ahead here. This also applies, for
example, to the business side. There we are really very bad at profiling even our own
customers. As a result, we still send the wrong content to customers or in the exit.
Whatever that happens on the consumer side. Of course, there are a little more the
pretentious part swimming over and things like this. But yes, that is of course just super
important.
Speaker: spk_3
Yes. Because investments have been made in the implementation of the AIP. That in itself is
a major investment. Or does that fall under engine What did you say? From the Adobe Sack
to. Because I think AIP is Adobe Experience platform. That is. So. Yes, that falls under
engine. Yes, exactly. So there is a lot of investment in that. But there is still a lot of data and
relay in another old system probably. And that is not brought together.
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes. Yes. But let me put it this way, but you guys do some cross-section interviews in time.
But my observation, and I talk about it most often with Wilco. It's closer. That there is
absolutely little speed, little priority sees her about. Yes. Okay. So that is important, also
ultimately in the direction of prospectus. But you could indeed work with such a locking
strategy. only if you can't really do it according to the follow-up. that you can't make the
customers good then it bleeds to death a bit.
Speaker: spk_3
Yes. Well. Yes. So I think those dynamic contracts are interesting. Because then you can
indeed test this kind of system like Home Energy Services on that group. Because of course
it is also relevant to them. So of course it also gives you a kind of advantage of Okay, we can
already start building up that capability. before the energy transition is fully underway.
Paul Dwarshuis
Sure, but you have to do that, right? That actually represents all those solutions. You don't
have to make a profit model out of it right away. But you have to go along. You can't say in
five years, then suddenly you're going to do it. So that's yes, that does cost a bit for the
benefit. And you have to keep the choice afloat with your commodity. Yes. And certainly go
along with these kinds of developments. And I think that in itself is also positive that we
said first, for example. Well, we want to be a solutions player. Okay, doesn't work. adjust
our strategy and we will try to get more to the hemrol. Yes. I think that has been a very good
adjustment.
Raban
But Paul, I just heard you nuance that nuance of I also see snags in the hemdomain. and
the role of fall to fall. As if I understood correctly, earlier in this conversation. Can you tell
us a bit more about that what nuances you see. But certainly also what opportunities there
are
Paul Dwarshuis
. Yes. yes, don't snag that I think of We can that we shouldn't do. but more that we And then
you also have to do some research on what is in the market. But there are many parties that
are already in this area. So we are not too late there. That's more my concern. So the
parties it is only about me the origin of this world are already working on it. But also the
what is it called? Shell has been busy. At least I know with this. You have small batches, a la
solar plan you just have to look at. Yes. For him it is an insanely broad concept. So true.
What is its definition? And what gives you the edge to go a little too far within the distance.
but at least to be competitive. I do have some doubts about that. Yes. I also asked that in
that workshop of his, who tells us that we should have a right to win here I believe. right to
play. Yes. I think we will investigate that a bit further. But club will probably do that. But
there is already quite a lot of market. Yes, no
Raban
once. Is there indeed some kind of vision at the moment of what role can be played there?
Or is that still very much discussion and stakeholders look at it very differently?
Paul Dwarshuis
No, I think this is now. Look, this, what you this slide has just been shared, approved.
People recognize themselves in it. Of course, there is also some data behind it. It is as Sven
has certainly been able to share. It is not without reason that they are just given up on this.
But no, so in itself I think daily for this approach. But yes, I think it needs some more
research. to win this. Yes, just for a moment
Raban
. Yes, especially then what propositions could Vatten fall there to bring to the market. And I
understood that IV, for example, is already seen. as a kind of first building block. Which
Vatten trap also has live, huh?
Paul Dwarshuis
True. True. Yes. Yes, that is possible. Well, I don't know if that's really live or if it's already
upcoming. I was also a bit over that. Yes, I think yes, yes, again, I'll just repeat it. But I don't
feel it. I find it difficult to say what the competitive field is like. Yes. I feel like we're happy
with something where competitors. And it doesn't necessarily have to be an energy plea. It
can also just be another party in the market. is already quite a bit of a challenge. Yes, on
this scene.
Raban
And Paul, if Vattenf cannot claim a dominant role in this. what do you think the future role
of Venal looks like? Or what is your perspective on that?
Paul Dwarshuis
Well, then I'm not super positive about that. And No, then I actually foresee that there will
be even more pressure on those monty prices eventually. Yes. And in the end, it's always
about margin. Because the prices will gradually be raised. Because across the board will of
course be later in the future. More and more taxes are levied. But that give, but that applies
to everyone. Yes. But the piece of margin that is with the supplier. That will be natural. That
then becomes thinner and thinner. Yes.
Raban
Yes, exactly. Yes. So.
Paul Dwarshuis
And. So yes, I think yes, for such a big twist. Then I think I think you should work with a lot
more of bel here. Yes.
Raban
Yes. And you can see that that is a scenario that the board realizes that it is a bit do or die.
We must fully commit to this. And that action can be taken, or is that very unlikely?
Paul Dwarshuis
You mean that we really have to follow him or
Raban
that you. Yes, exactly that the organization is committed to that
Paul Dwarshuis
. The sensor urgency there. Yes. Yes. Yes. Very nice that we connect EV to it. But yes, and
then it will take another year before we have the heat pump on. and another year before it
then. Yes, the pace is way too slow, I think.
Speaker: spk_3
Is that? Is that a broader problem at all? That often large company that you have a bit of
speed compared to well, at least the small challengers. But maybe also other big players.
Yes, it
Paul Dwarshuis
is exactly what you say. It is a bit part of large large companies. And on the other hand,
there are more and more techniques with the incubators and so on. To get things live
quickly. That you rent a floor somewhere and this, for example. This is of course a great
subject to develop outside. and with a link to the collar or something somewhere. So that,
yes, I think so. And the great thing is that I have worked at three large companies. It went
well for two years, but I just really saw it deteriorate. It just takes a very long time before you
get things through. Yes. But what I miss a bit is. And then you can say a lot of things about
banks. But there was often a mentality of We make the cut, huh. And it is also filled. Yes
with other. But the cut at V was also filled. And then you put in a lot of effort. We are pulling
a few million forward here.
Speaker: spk_3
Yes, New T is a good example.
Paul Dwarshuis
He caught.
Speaker: spk_3
New T is of course a good example of the ABN. However they do that. Oh, I have that too. I
also have one or not for that with Daniel Oh. Maybe it was after your time. Yes, I think so. I
was on
Paul Dwarshuis
the very first hour with Patrick Pfaff. Well, I didn't know that one. I came from the Silskant.
And it's kind of his idea to make a trip to England, America. And I didn't come up with that
idea. Yes. But yes, New Ten, yes
Speaker: spk_3
. But yes, that is indeed a good example of how you can quickly launch something within
such a logging company.
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes. I also believe in that, a bit of symbolic politics is not the right word. That has a bit of a
negative connotation. But sometimes it's just good to do things like that in that way. Then
things come to life, then people feel like it. Yes, it gets a bit popping. Anyway, that was
mine.
Speaker: spk_3
Engine had that too, I noticed very much when I was in the engine team. Only I noticed that
the rest of the organization was not really on board with engine. I ran into it every now and
then.
Paul Dwarshuis
No. True. And then you also notice that it is now ebbing away a bit. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. So.
We have another one that I still have here. I have not investigated that at all. But only in the
context of opportunity finding. And. A lot happens in a house. That is of course also
something to realize. That of course, for example, we call it a meter cupboard. I have
spoken to some parties. That's more fun for my role. I am one of the most external,
outwardly focused. That of course more and more alarm systems are being connected to it.
All kinds of demotics are being used Everyone is just tinkering around. But that whole
infrastructure in those houses especially the meter cupboard. He is also quite on the luke.
So maybe it's a step further than just him. But that you really have to tackle the home
infrastructure. And then with a party like Veenstra, for example, perhaps a nice vehicle to
play a role in that
Speaker: spk_3
. Yes. Yes. Because where do you think indeed. Because of course we are talking about
dynamic contacts. We talked about hims. We talked about different target groups. Where.
Where should you? Where should the growth come from as far as you feel? That's a pretty
broad question. But you must have checked about it.
Paul Dwarshuis
No, I understand. You mean the hundred room here. Yes, exactly
Speaker: spk_3
. Yes
Paul Dwarshuis
, which I believe in and what we just said, that remark I also made to Giovanna this
morning. I think this is just a horizon too far for us. to take advantage of in the next two
years. And so says a lot, of course a certain group can invest as a kind of spearhead. So
depending on the calculation and volume, we should certainly not rule it out. But where I
think we are going to make the biggest hit. And I think also told in those introduction
rounds. We have quite a lot of great plans. And But I think it's very important to really bring
some things to execution. For example, about lead management, but also about
personalization. And allowing you to create a branding, branding and engagement. If only
we orchestrate that very well. I really see it as an orchestra in that respect, with different
groups. Some are within Jolanda's department, but also some outside it. And that that is
apart from what the content of branding will be. Then we are now purely about the
connection of all those clubs. If that orchestra starts playing in the same time. to make it
metformer. I think that can make a very big difference in attracting new customers. and
certainly also in keeping. Yes. And I think if you take an essent, for example. that he is there
at the moment. just succeeds much better. have a very consistent message. If you are an
example according to the Even, huh. Yes, it's a very silly example, but the US commercial.
then go to Ff.nl slash T. And licking with my son taps that thing in. Well, the first time it gets
stuck. Well it can happen. Well, then you look, you end up on offer and then you click on
offer, you think. Then I thought in five or six years what exactly is for my consumption. I
think Well, go back for a moment. Also fixed. Because it just can't stand. But there was no
button back either, you know? So I could go under the browser. Yes, of course those are
experiences at that moment that are just really hopeless. They're just very micro, aren't
they? Yes. But there are ultimately reasons why people drop out again. Yes. Those are
things. Yes, that's just a top sport. Every bag moment you have with a prospect. I also
presented him as a prospect. And they are. Yes, then you just have to score.
Speaker: spk_3
And if there is a bit of a change, it will become operational. But then there is none. Why is
that so? Is there no feedback loop? Is there indeed the missing data to identify those kinds
of bottlenecks? And there Or is it known and they don't experiment on it?
Paul Dwarshuis
No idea. I see the silent play when Del's team is. And that falls under wilk. There is a lot of
testing and the like taking place there. Yes, phases to do. Yes, I can hardly say that. Yes, the
sufficient diminished interest. So it may also be that it is simply not optimized enough.
Speaker: spk_3
Yes. But indeed, you say Okay, we have the idea that there. There are already a lot of good
ideas. But undoubtedly there are already the right ideas. maybe even a bit on the backlogs.
But it has to be put down with enough force. And. Yes. What would indeed be our role in
this? Do you need to possibly substantiate those plans more strongly? That there will be a
good business case for it? Or does it just take an outsiderin yes, perspective at all to give
that extra strength? Or is it, where do you see our contribution there
Paul Dwarshuis
. Well, look, the whole process has some form of legitimation of course. It's always good
when people from outside say things. I also notice that there is value in that at Vattenfall,
shall I say. Yes. That is why it was also very important in this process. an A-brand consultant
really came on board. So that certainly plays a role, that will certainly help. But I honestly
think that's what I call it. Theo Jolanda himself in it. that they just don't have enough know-
how. more organizational know-how. How you can solve these kinds of yes, yet
comprehensive problems, I call it. Challenges. Yes. How you tackle them as an
organization as a whole. Yes. There is a kind of there. There are a lot of people who are in
MTV. are good in their field. So many specializations have often been doing it for years. He
has other disadvantages about them, creativity or things like that. But how you threaten to
connect the chain, I just call it connecting. That is little idea and vision on that. I think that's
how I put it. And then you get that chain every time. Clearly it is a long chain. do not fit
together sufficiently. Yes. Yes, I'm there now, there is a cultural aspect of course in it of
showing yourself, what dare you, how at then you are in communication, but also just in
just doing things. Yes. So that's, yes, I don't know if that's going outside is almost out of risk
of a project. But the ownership and delegation, shall I say. That is also difficult. At festivals,
there is quite a lot of consultation. Which is also sometimes misled, you know. But And You
can go to the song. Yes, yes.
Raban
Yes. Yes, Paul. You actually list a few weaknesses of vattenval in a row. . I am also curious
what you really see as vattenval's most important forces in the market. And also in the
competitive landscape. Could you tell us something about that.
Paul Dwarshuis
Mhm. can be quite bad. And well, I think that's a real strength. In itself, I think the fire
should start from above. the fire is a strength. Of course, the brand values are not optimal
at the moment. But in itself you still see I think it's striking, let me put it that way. that the
top three will keep their market position for so long. That doesn't actually fall below twenty
percent. It is also eroding a bit now. But there is apparently a kind of majority in the market.
who always keeps going for those A-Bands. And apparently thinks that no power or gas may
come out of contact. if you go to an unknown party or unknown party. So of course there is
always a certain certain force. And I think our online capabilities should be sturdy. So we
really have a well-functioning app. We have good site, good mining environment. and also
won the prizes and the like in the past. So I think that goes there anyway what the what is
going well. And let's think about what more are really big pluses. Yes, I'm mainly looking for
things that are really plus. So not things that are good, but that everyone actually has. I
think that those are actually the most important things. Yes. I think you may think it's weird
that I don't think customer or say something. But I just really don't think so. No. It is
Raban
Your opinion that we ask? Yes.
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes, definitely. Yes. Well, I think. Look, I'm standing. Anyway, that is of course always their
own store. But I do stand very much for the people who work face-to-face with clients. Of
which I'm actually almost the only one who has that. I am very much in charge of the
people, together with customer service. And. But I do notice on a daily basis. that is not
always in mind in other departments. that basically everything you do should be in a
drawing of a customer. Yes. And that smallest centricity where quite high is always
mentioned. That's just not the No, that's not above average, let me put it that way.
Speaker: spk_3
You call good website the my environment in the app. Actually as very strong as strength.
So that in itself is interesting of course. And are they so good. Because you have good
development in-house. Because they are good at developing things quickly. Or. How is it
possible that they are so good?
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes, small discla that more that I see it from News Basporus say market research, that kind
of thing. So I can hardly find nature myself from my own experience. that I myself am some
of. But that it reserves it for a while. But. Yes, I think what I just said with you that there is a
power of a certain focus there. There are just people. I also happened to experience them a
while ago in an opportunity auction session. who are just Yes, enormously dedicated in
delivering and doing good. And I think there is just a lot of focus on that. And that's also
what I mean by focus within the field. is usually reasonably well cared for in Athen. But of
course it's also about whether you have a focus on sharing in the collaboration between
disciplines. Yes. But I think they are also really anticipating tests, feedback loops, things
like that. I think that's a good thing, especially with the app, it's often a well-known app. But
that it is better and more easily taken care of than many other departments and processes.
And really very short cyclical. Of course, a lot of that kind of thing in customer service. But
yes, of course it is all less louder and clearer to act on feedback immediately.
Speaker: spk_3
Yes.
Raban
I have a here. Yes, like that. By the way, we still have ten minutes to go. So maybe we think
we should take a look. Because Paul, we really had a lot more questions. But the topics we
discuss are so interesting. that we take a little more time for that. So we have to get it right.
Paul Dwarshuis
I don't have a hard stop now, but I still have to finish something for Cindy. Yes, exactly. I
don't know. But I'm totally fine with it, because I also like to add extra money next week.
Raban
. Otherwise we are still a bit up to date with this. Tuesday exactly.
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes. That is.
Raban
That might be in between. Yes, we'll do that in a small extension sometime next week. But
for now, let's focus on the most important few questions of tactics and strategy. Yes. I
wanted to discuss this one again. Also strategy, focus on high eusage and due to heat
bumps or EV charges or something. So it was actually said from the strategy of These are
the customer groups. Yes, based on the solutions we want to focus on. The current
percentages are very low, aren't they? Three percent, five percent, one and two percent.
What is the best way to interpret this slide? According to you, it goes. Is it really the strategy
to get the most acquisition from there? If you look at growth in the coming years.
Paul Dwarshuis
And yes, with the nuance that I don't think there is a visibility check on it. In the sense that it
is meant more of a lot happening here. And we want to play a role in this. But whether we
can play a role in it is still a while Yes, that also depends on that time figurines in the end.
Yes. But these are the groups where it will happen. I do share that opinion based on the
knowledge I have now. Yes.
Raban
And why do you think that growth will take place there? for what falls.
Paul Dwarshuis
Well, whether it will happen, that's the second one. That depends on whether you also have
your capabilities, I'll call it. Or your solutions or your lead machine solutions. Or that you
are in conservation, for that role. But in itself, these are if you just look at social trends. that
are currently going on. And an electricity price that is going to rise. But also more and more
consumers who are starting to think greener. And now again with floods in Spain. Yes.
People are going further and more sustainable. That is a trend that will continue. the solar
panels. The people who don't have them now will probably take them in when they move
later, they think, let's add those solar panels too. So yes. It just takes time, but that
development is continuing. That also happens with the EV. if you see how much violence,
for example, the Chinese alone are now of course just going wild. Yes. And how that
actually catches on. The second-hand EV market is now starting to catch on more and
more. So those are things that are really going to take hold. I really believe that. Yes, once,
once. So slower, but I think the impact is ultimately big or bigger. Yes, if
Raban
they like you indeed did. I also saw that in an analysis of what the fall. And I also agree that
affordability is of course critical for many people. And that many people can't afford the
solutions either, huh. That is also a clear trend that is under pressure. Actually a trend that
is working against this at the moment. Yes.
Paul Dwarshuis
This is really one that you don't realize at first. But of course this is really a what do you call
it? Yes, really a split in the companies in terms of income. Because of course we saw that
when the energy erupted. Then there were people who had pennies. They immediately
went to buy full banks of solar panels. Yes. And they brought down their energy bills in the
process. Yes. Yes, those are people in the rental properties. They often can't. Yes. So that
really creates a divide, at least in terms of income. Yes. Absolutely. Yes. Yes. And. Yes, that's
not in here. Then you also try to contribute to it in a different way as a company.
Raban
Yes. Okay, one last thing about this record. And then maybe in Wouter van Velis you also
have a closing question. But the biggest challenge is to achieve the acquisition objectives.
Well, this is of course completely close to you this statement. But looking at those figures
of customer numbers ambition. There we seen two hundred and eighty-one zero and three
hundred and ninety-nine zero. And what is the plan for two thousand and twenty-five Is it
true that our assignment is about securing part of that target? Or do you still see that this
has to be added on top of these targets? That was a question I had. So to make it sharp. For
example, there is now four hundred zero in two thousand and twenty-five. We are of course
talking about one hundred and fifty to two hundred zero new customers in two thousand
and twenty-five and two thousand twenty-six How do we correlate them with this target?
And also yes, what are the plans for the part that we are not going to work on, huh. So two
hundred zero four hundred zero for two thousand and twenty-five alone I was just curious
how that works from you.
Paul Dwarshuis
And. Well, the two number of things. The It's a downstand on. Take a look, say two
thousand and twenty gee going back. And we were able to turn the knobs pretty well. in the
sense of out door to door walk nicely. Those numbers I mentioned at the beginning, well
over a hundred thousand. And if we did a bit sharper proposition there. we saw the
numbers go up there. And price comparison sites were not as hot then as they are now. So
well, fine, then you call that for the yawn. Turn on the price comparison tap. For example,
with a slightly higher cashback or a somewhat lower rate. Yes. And with that, we always
overtook the position quite easily. What you saw happen next is that the door started to
walk away. Anyone who said a beginning of a k. And the competition on price comparison
sites and also online, so our own site. it actually got bigger and bigger. We saw that we also
went very deep. And we actually didn't anymore, those numbers could be added. So we
have lost that buffer a bit over time. And that is mainly the buffer of doorte door. I think we
have also lost a bit. Because we are simply not high enough in the consideration anymore.
and the traffic we generate. Yes. So that's kind of where we come from. So then we said in
this process, what did we actually do in the past on door to door, huh. Where was our
buffer? How big was it? And we actually popped it a bit on that one hundred and fifty K. So
that's where that comes from, huh. And we actually want to get them back online. to
reduce that dependence on those price comparison sites. But also to be able to play a little
more with our channel mix. Yes. So that we can also have a little more value left. Now we
are often forced to pay at insanely low rates and cashbacks. And in particular through the
price comparison sites. but sometimes also through our own site. Yes. So that's kind of
where we come from. And if you look at this, I think it is interesting to realize. I don't want to
say three hundred and ninety-nine is some kind of longshot. It depends on how much.
Look, in the end, B-stabilization is the most important objective. We just don't want to lose
a market target. So it also depends on how much churn there is. Yes. So opposite this
acquisition target there is also a churn target. And if that is disappointing, the churn is
higher. Then you don't have to do three hundred and ninety-nine, but then you have to do
four hundred and ninety-nine. it's not that bad. It is lower than we think now. We now have
nine percent, he says. And then you don't have to do three ninety-nine, but two ninety-nine.
Speaker: spk_3
So we don't just look for customers. But customers who stay. Otherwise we will shoot
ourselves in the foot. . Exact
Paul Dwarshuis
exact. That is of course very important. And we also told that in those rounds with you of
Yes. Really those prices relax after a little more, because otherwise we also lose too much
value. So a very unambiguous answer of Is this in there or not is a bit difficult to give. But
given that historical picture. I think at least half of what we've said is seventy-five that it's
now in that three hundred and ninety-nine. Yes. Okay. Yes. Yes.
Raban
Yes. Beautiful. Yes. It has indeed already happened in previous conversations. Or it came
back that there was talk about what is a new customer. I think it would be good if we could
really get that together for this project. The one with the Value Three S. Among other things,
with the Value Tree session. That we have a good scope of what we see as a new customer.
in order to ultimately set up the right way in the right way in the validation. Which
opportunities will actually result in that. So let's all look at that together to see how we see
that definition.
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes, I don't know which direction you want to define. But in any case, I can say for this
project, a new customer is a customer who buys EG or both. Because that, as I said, also in
addition to those solutions, that's just where the challenge lies at the moment. And that is
still our cork. So it's exaggerated if we will soon have around fifty zero hatpump customers.
then that does not solve the problem. because we can install a lot of energy points. Yes.
Raban
So electricity and gas or both. That's the scoop. They are. So SCARY. One of the two or
both?
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes, I'm a trend in that too, huh. That slowly turns the number of contracts. the number of
contracts per household is falling. Yes. Because more and more are getting rid of gas. So I
think it was one ninety-two. And so you have to bring in relatively a little more households.
to get your contract plans. Yes. is a bit more of definition. I don't rule out the possibility that
we will be talking in three years' time. No longer talking about contracts, but about
customers. Yes. Households. Yes. Well, that's
Raban
Not now. Interesting. I also think ENG or both who focus very clearly also the first horizon
and the tactics tribe that I think will deal with that. And on the other hand, you also see in
the strategy that there must be a movement towards solutions and Home Energy Services
eventually. And certainly. And there you also want to identify those propositions more
clearly. And. Yes. It would be a different scoop for that for this project, Paul?
Paul Dwarshuis
if we wanted to do more on that solut
Raban
. Exactly the horizon two and three that are a bit further in the future. And in which we. Yes,
sure, can
Paul Dwarshuis
yes, it is possible. But then it would really have to be complementary. that it is a trigger in a
way. or a retention mechanism or something along those lines. Yes. But we are not going to
tackle the problem by pushing very hard. or we look at what good solar panels we have
Raban
. No, it should eventually lead to ONG. Yes. Or finally E.
Paul Dwarshuis
Yes. Well, they Well, which I think is very interesting. I don't know if you have been able to
read that documentation of that flow resulting. This is about lead management. Yes. Of
course, it is something that concerns people. So it can be critical in generating leads.
solutions and the like.
Speaker: spk_3
And especially because your capabilities of your website and the like are very strong. you
can of course create solutions reasonably well there. which you can then use for lead
management.
Paul Dwarshuis
Exact. The best thing is if you are natural, of course they really work on that. that you do a
combination solution EEG, huh. So the time price, for example, that you can best charge
the car at certain times and things like that. Yes. There is probably a perhaps the strongest
strongest solution there. Yes.
Raban
Yes. Yes. Yes, interesting. I think certainly for the somewhat mid-term future. that it is also
very interesting to look at other revenue models. Although I do understand that of course
the focus is now mainly on ENG. But towards the future, things may change. No, certainly,
that
Paul Dwarshuis
is. It's also a bit much in far out. Of course, it is quite a lot of companies in the future. or in
the past. who do completely different things nowadays. And But you see that of course it
never happens within a year. Because you can't put all your people on the street, keep all
your people. Yes. But you reduce it a bit from very slowly. That may take up to ten years
before you. No, and in the end it can turn around. that as a company you still have a floor
five somewhere or somewhere on the Zuidas as the case. Yes. And that you are more of a
technology company then. Then a commoditch driver. That would of course be very good.
Yes. Yes.
Speaker: spk_3
Especially if those capabilities are strong in-house. Then that's not such a crazy thought.
Beautiful. We are through time. I. I think we can talk about it for a very long time. Seen given
your background. But I I. I can imagine that with offline there is also a lot of knowledge and
insight that should not be lost. And potentially could also be delivered for digital sales. Yes.
Are those knowledge flows managed, so to speak? as well as in all the insights gained
offline. that they somehow flow to digital to come up with a strategy.
Paul Dwarshuis
Of tactics
Speaker: spk_3
. Well
Paul Dwarshuis
, not organized, let me put it that way. I No, not really organized. The action I said comes
together very much in that acquisition team. Yes, between the channels and the marketers,
for example. But we are not actively working on a certain way to guarantee learning there,
so to speak. Well. In any case, I say it in front of me. Yes. Well, maybe.
Speaker: spk_3
No. We can look.
Paul Dwarshuis
Customer learnings and so on are really all shared. And. Yes. And that's not where it's super
structured. But there is a feedback loop in it. There is also frequent consultation between
marketers and those salesforces. Yes. If that's what you mean, yes. But not that we're
saying Hey, we see that offline is almost sinking online. How do we do a kind of handover?
There is nothing to read into at the moment. Well okay
Speaker: spk_3
. Okay. Learnings are shared. But then. Then I might find it interesting to see it. Indeed.
Final. They are of course direct con-. In the end, of course, digital is behind his computer.
And will never really speak to anyone. Or yes, I'll name just a few. Maybe door to door
knows very well about Well, I notice that gardens that look very raked. That they have the
best chance of conversion. And we can do digital with satellite images. Just to name a few.
But in any case. Of course, there could be quite a few insights that have been provided.
Paul Dwarshuis
Certainly. No, what I say, they are tolerated in themselves. And that is often just done
verbally. and then they come into the good zens they are drowned. And then they get to the
backlog. And then they are arrested when there is a good case for it. But that things like that
happen. So app customizations indeed, for example. But also the first to start with certain
solutions for certain companies are stored. They are working on a tablet where they all
collect on. um So yes, in itself. Those things are done. Not super structured, but. Yes. But I
think so, especially if you might even want to say goodbye to part of the channel one day.
that you can organize that better. Okay. Check.
Raban
Yes. Okay, I think we can keep the remaining amounts tonight as well. Because you still
have something to finish, Paul. I don't want you your Friday. stretch your Friday until later
another five hours. I hope you can finish it within an hour.
Paul Dwarshuis
Well, I always have to say I like that when they make presentations at the end. What great
music. Right. But I always have to struggle with these kinds of things. Because I don't have
the idea after it's already going to read it. Anyway, the agreement was that the N or D would
be in the mailbox. So maybe she'll do it tomorrow morning, no idea. But it has to go out the
door.
Raban
Is there also a small special beer on the desk or eh La
Paul Dwarshuis
Chouf, huh? Well, to be wrong, I don't know. I never really do that. If more ps psychological
thinking than because I would no longer function. But. No. Then I made my beer lacf qua
special. So that one. Yes, it will be either a glass of wine or indeed a sjoefke. Beautiful. I.
No, that's right.
Raban
I often go to the cinema in Amsterdam, to the movies. ONE of the oldest cinemas in
Amsterdam. I have a subscription there. I know him. Yes. And I always get a la sjoe for when
I go to the movies there. Very good. I'm a fan too.
Paul Dwarshuis
Vilma has also been a few times. Amusing. Nice, huh? Yes. Yes, yes, I have heard a
circumstance. twelve, twelve, thirteen years. Yes. So. Then you know him, yes. Well, you're
doing good. Well, you also enjoy the weekend? Yes, we do very nice to talk about things a
little further. Yes. So we're going to do it next week or maybe indeed stay in between
Tuesday. by grabbing a slot for it. Certainly, please
Raban
. Very nice, because that is super useful for us. Also your perspective, I hope everyone. Yes.
Beautiful. Okay. Have a good weekend. And speaking next week. We will schedule
something with you.
Paul Dwarshuis
Okay then. Good.
Speaker: spk_3
Okay. Thanks. Let me see. We still have. I I
Raban
I do have the feeling that this is actually just secretly a growth tactics project. Because all
growth should actually come from you within two years. Yes. Because before you have a
new proposition live. it really often takes at least two years.
Speaker: spk_3
It's funny. While indeed when you speak to a world coach, it seems like a tactics no.
Raban
Wilco wants to talk about Ser.
Speaker: spk_3
Well. Yes, I already have that idea. Well, I don't know. Maybe I feel it all wrong too.
Raban
Can you turn it off and that recording. telephone? Oh.






**Judith (Strategy research)**

G Giovanna 0:00
OK, starting off now and turning on co-pilot, brilliant. So, um, Judith, I'd
like to understand, uh, first, uh, just a basic question, um, can you share
a bit of your journey in uh in Vattenfall and, uh, your role andwhat is
your team responsible for, um, what are your main activities? What, what
are theKPIs that you measured against thevalue that you bring to the,
to the company?
J Judith 0:27
Yeah, I can share some slides because Iwas expecting this question.
J Judith 0:36
So herewe are, this is the Customs and Solutions Netherlands and I
workwithin the strategy department, uh, which is basically some sort of
staff f
unction within our business unit andwithin the team of strategy. I
work, I'm responsible for research topics together with my direct
colleague Eric, but we also have, um, you know, you see here strategists,
people from business development. This has changed, but I'm regular,
sorry, and uhwe, we, yeah, well, we have ambitions on helping to lead,
uh, helping to lead our management team, helping people to, you know,
to transform what I mean by that is, for example, you know, we, uh, we
have a strategy, weuhwewe define it, we redefine it every once in a
while. Um, that is led by the strategist, uh, team members, andwe do
some desk research that is, for example, EI that uh contribute in that
way, andwe help people to, um, uh, um, how do you say to connect with
Saved Share EditableJudith (Strategy research) G
Browse Upgrade
Search or ask anything G
their yearly plans in the several departments within our business unit as
well and some development. And so, to be more specific, we do, for
example, strategies, a B2B strategy, B2C strategy for the consumer
market, for small business market, SUTU2roadmap is comesfrom our
team, um, of course, together with a lot of colleagues, but, um, well, it
has been written by our manager. Uh, influencing plans, uh, so that's
more the regulatory side of
business, for example, certain new laws or
developments in The Hague, together with thewhole branch branch,
well, you know, all energy companies aligned. Um, so more the political
part, strategies, for example, a direct colleague, uh, is a f
ull-time, uh,
working on the green gas, how to get more green gass, how, how, you
know, in what ways there are, of course, several scenarios to do that. We
have some obligations comingup, for example, by ching, so 20% needs
to beum green gass, which is like crazy, uh.
J Judith2:59
Crazy target, but anyways, we, we, we have to see how
far we can come.
And for example, can we do, um, yeah, piers of pilingup, for example.
J Judith 3:13
Uh, you know, how do people think about the price developments since
the energy crisis. So different types of consumers, customers, non-
customers, or markets shares switching behavior in the consumer
market, or engagement campaigns, measurements, posts, or for
example, for the team who develops a lot of solutions or new
propositions, so to test that. Um, yes, service promises, well, those
types of things, andwe help in key topics and key topicsfor contributing
to the to the strategic pillars. So, you know, as, as you are aware of, I
think, andwhen I showed you last timewe discussed it, yes, yeah, so
that. Um, and, andwhat is key that is, yeah, dependable on what the
management team asksfrom us or what, what our manager think is
most key.
J Judith 4:22
Um, so, for example, communication, a new communication strategy,
that's somethingwework on um or um yeah, several sort of concept
testing, well, it's a lot of Topics and as I said, strategy projects.
J Judith 4:41
Um, now I used to work on that matter as well, but now I moved to more
visualization and Eric continues to work on this, um, yeah, and smaller
questions we, we, we help, so.
G Giovanna 4:55
Yeah. So, so let me just, let meunderstand. So, um, you are, so the
entire researchum chapter or team is responsible for feedinguh
strategic uh findings to the overall um strategic pillars, but also overall
business strategy of the company, uh, and thevision, but also Um, is
also used to support to test to validate new concepts andvalue
propositions as well as the communication strategy for prospects and
current customers.
J Judith 5:32
Yeah, yeah, but we are not the only one conducting research or testing
propositions or asking for feedback.
J Judith 5:40
Um, it's, it's organized, yeah, I think historically, you know, I can't really
uh. you know, tell you avery good story on why some things are here
andwhy some things are somewhere else. But when it comes to more
the C part of things, so customer journey mapping that's being
conductedwithin the same department. So that's a different, that's a
different department.
J Judith 6:06
And um some sort of solution testing has been donewithin that team
itself. So, um, for example, when they have new products and they want
to, you know, do some sort of dummy test to checkwhether people are
actually, you know, try to click, yeah, yeah, those types of tests they do
over there. Within market and commercial operations, they do, of
course, the testing, all sorts of things. Well, you know
better than me,
that type of things, andwithin the digital data and IT a lot of testing has
been done as well and um. Within that team, yeah, so it's either here or
here, they have that that um energy app um consumer group, and they
conduct research as well. So that's a collaboration between those two.
G Giovanna 7:03
IT and customer experience.
J Judith 7:06
So yeah, andwithin all these, you know, these different labels, different
brands, they they do research as well.
G Giovanna 7:14
So but they have their own UX research dedicated team.
J Judith 7:18
No, no, no, these brands are too small for that. OK, sometimes they do a
UX research or they asked us ifwe can help, and yeah, so that's no clear
answer to I can provide you
with.
G Giovanna 7:32
OK, but it's distributed then you have a few research teams distributed
among Yeah, no teams, persons who have, you know, part of their job, a
few hours doing this.
J Judith 7:47
So basically Alex Wesselin, the one I mentioned earlier, that's the one
who'sf
ully focused on UX research and, and, and knows about has this
app consumer group, so that's the. That's the person I think, and
therefore, I, I, you know, I, I, I mentioned it, uh, that's the person I think
it's, it's handy for you to talk to.
J Judith 8:12
Um, next to, for example, somebody from the customer experience
management team, I think Fle Fleur mentioned someoneum.
G Giovanna 8:25
I'm in touchwithuhwith someone I think from uh OK, so that's.
G Giovanna 8:31
OK, and um.
G Giovanna 8:33
OK, I think that's clear in terms of
uh your role and uh your
responsibilities, um, when it comes to.
G Giovanna 8:42
So I'm, I'm wondering, shall we, what about, what do you think, shall we
dive in the the strategy part?
G Giovanna 8:50
Yeah, it's good, yeah, OK, so, uh, if the one can still your your screen
again.
G Giovanna 8:56
Um, we know that there is um avery clear direction into by 2030moving
towards solutions, right? So this, this is a slide that we discussed quite a
few times already. Uh, I'd like to, to understand from your sidewhat do
you think are the opportunities that lie hadwithin the strategic
directions? What are the things that uh have been developed? What are
things that have been being discussing to bring this to life and to really
see this uh this shift in terms of positioning?
J Judith 9:27
Yeah, um, is it OK if I can keep on slide sharing, but I think it's most
handy if I show you because yes, indeed that that's so that's, for
example, and Sona of my team who are res, um, they indeed made this
slide and um what's lying. So you know, I try to explain, but they can
explain in far more detail than I can. Uh, but like currently, it's more
about, you know, we trying to conduct a one size fits all kind of approach
to be, um, you know, to be frank. And, um, but the f
uture is more
towards like, you know, home energy services, for example, um.
J Judith 10:17
And offering solutions, of course, and you can do, you can do that in
several ways. And so that's what we, um, well, they, the strategies have
together with colleaguesfrom the Department of Euro forLoan, for
example, have, you know, analyzed like, OK, offering solutions ourselves
as being far, um, that's not um. Uh, that's not realistic and it's also not
the most it's not preferable. For example, Feinstra or a daughter
company doesn't have enough people and doesn't have enough
capacity to to be able to follow
up, uh, because it's, you know, we have2
million people. If I don't know what percentagewants a solution, well,
fainar by itself can't liveup to that. So we need partners andwe also
don't have the capacities, the capabilities to be that, you know, very
much solution type of partner. So therefore, it's colored a little bit more
light, lightly. So basically be more of a kind of a lead or warm leads and
do a lot with partners. And the home energy services, that's also part of
a big strategy that has been part of a big strategy. Uh, projects, um, in
which, uh, my colleague has together with people from a lot of
departments within B2C and and other BUs have, you know, researched
that. So the, the outcome is that, OK, we should definitely focus also
moreuh into that focus more on that because and they use the parts I
can explain as good as they can, but um. Um, With the home energy
management system, people have more and more a relationship with
that.
J Judith 12:19
Home energy management device or whatever. And you don't want,
yeah, we don't want to be on the, on the backside of that. Wewant to
have the direct relationship with the customer. um it's very important to
maintain that direct. Relationship and the customer feels and knows, oh,
I am a I am a customer of photo, and not that we, you know, end up
being somewhere behind in line. But on the other hand, we also don't
want to, you have several roles within that home energy management
domain. You can of course also say, wewant to be that within that home
management, so everything. Goes withus, but we also don't want to
have that becausewe are not fit for that type of
being, that type of.
Company or partner, you need to be more IT um minded than we are. So
that's also not our strength to be there, but wewant to havewewant to
be that direct contact when it comes to charging, home charging, um,
you know, and and and and energy that which is needed for your home.
So, therefore, Um, this is the most this is the most important change
we've done compared to previous version of that strategy, that is that
we so more focus, so not, not, not again, not that massfor everyone, uh,
and more solution for more home energy services. So therefore you see
more, you know, strategy on customer groups. It's on it's on the next
slide. Um, and, uh, high households, because, yeah, of course, um.
That's the f
uture.
J Judith 14:11
Moree, less gas. So you know, and together with that home energy
management of Flex services that should be our new or more a f
uture
proof
uh model. Uh, so, so what we're saying here is that by focusing on
high households, we are targeting on customers that are more open to
sustainable solutions. Yeah, that's one of the groups. So basically you
have now at the moment, let's say 4, yeah, oh yeah, it's already 60%.
J Judith 14:46
That doesn't have a solution yet, and you can distinguish between yet
and Doesn't have and doesn't want to, you know, can. We don't know
how how
big these two groups are, but we do know it's 60%. So, and
that's our, you know, what we do now most. So we should try to keep,
keep that, um, but in addition, focus on several high E groups which are
here. So high E, for example, because they have solar panels, it's a bit of
a, you know, they also give back so. That's maybe a bit of a, but a lot of
people have it, but it's a bit of the odd one out maybe for now. But the
high E that's the person who has a home charging point or have a
combination of solar and and EV or solar and heat pump. And of course
you have the district heating, whichwe, yeah, well she.
W Wouter 15:44
Yeah, so why isn't there a specific target for traditional energy home
with sustainable potential? Why isn't there a split target there?
J Judith 15:53
I, oh, this is not targets, it's the size of the groups.
J Judith 15:59
So I don't know I don't know if there's, yeah, because I don't know what
the stage is now when it comes to, you know, um, I'm rolling out this
strategy. So my last information is that is this, but you should ask the
strategy people. Uh, because they are now in many highs, right, can
help us with this that many highs, highs can help us with this, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, yeah, so, so I
don't know about target setting at this point, but I do know that these
are the size of the groups at the moment.
G Giovanna 16:40
And a quick question because I thinkuh you supported on on this
research, correct?
J Judith 16:46
Uh, yeah, well, part of this.
G Giovanna 16:50
Um, is this calculation because there is a there is a blue, uh, remark, uh,
in the bottom right on this side, yeah, so it's an estimation is an
estimated percentage of NL consumers. Is this segmentation based on
the market or based on the current um uh customers?
J Judith 17:11
No, market market is this. OK, OK, brilliant.
G Giovanna 17:17
OK, sorry, continue. No, no, yeah, well, the only thing left, I think, well,
when it comes to this question is to mention, you know, we are in the
process now of kind of filling this trifi thing, so to say, so we need to
define.
J Judith 17:35
This thing for each of the the the strategy level segments as we call it so
these these things so the so the next step is by understanding each one
strategic customer segment, then we can plug in what our solutions and
and installation potential solutions and installationsfor those.
G Giovanna 17:56
potential energy services. What is the potential ENG product loyalty, and
this is now this is also a strategic project now.
J Judith 18:05
So, the same he is in this to develop this together with a few other
colleagues.
J Judith 18:13
OK. So when it comes to, you know, what is the status in this he is the
same person you should have also follow-up question on this brilliant.
G Giovanna 18:24
I think you have a few more slides coming.
J Judith 18:28
No, I, well, no, no, no, this was what I presented last time.
J Judith 18:32
Hewas not able to come, so therefore I, I, I showed you this.
G Giovanna 18:37
Yeah, and yeah, well, this is more detail, so I don't know, yeah.
J Judith 18:42
You know, there are a lot of key trends and um yeah, so we this is it's
now quite small, I realize, but Yeah, so there are a lot of slides again,
what you should talk to, but I mean this is part of that home energy
management.
G Giovanna 19:01
Oh good, we already have all these lights as well.
G Giovanna 19:04
Iwas just curious around the the the slides and the present all the
reports that you showed in that one slider. That was um onewas talking
about uh strategy, the other onewas talking about um theum the
reducing CO2strategy, all of those. Can you sharewithus these
documents? I think these these can bevery helpf
ul, um, becausewe
have a few of them.
J Judith 19:38
Yeah, but I, I don't know about the strategy. No, these are not relevant
for us.
G Giovanna 19:44
I think the relevant would be pilingwe already have, right? Yeah, yeah, I
sent you this one and I think this one as well.
J Judith 19:55
And because I, you know, I, this, this, these are the ones I've sent you.
J Judith20:02
The bra tracking. I sent you the branch tracking Q2as well. That's that's
an international research. Um, this is the salesflow which is conducted
by a colleague from Wilco's team, I think, end of 2022, together with
Rock. So this is this is an example of a qualitative research, um.
J Judith20:27
This is about a campaign.
J Judith20:30
Um, which is conducted in August, yeah, so you also see a category
entry points.
J Judith20:36
That are important for consumers. Um, I believe, yeah, that's the one
you have the other one, yeah.
J Judith20:48
Yeah.
G Giovanna20:49
OK, brilliant, I thinkwewe have the most relevant then.
J Judith20:53
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, yeah, OK, um, when it comes to, so we do have a
question in regards to maybe, maybe, um, you can help us withwhen it
comes to the four, strategic segments and also the the, the, the, the 4
customer groups that we have or the behavioral model that we have, uh,
for CM so let me share my uh can you please share your screen and
share the two.
G Giovanna21:22
Cush resides Iwas, Iwas wonderingwhat is the correlation between
them. And uh if you can takeus through maybe the2nd. The second,
uh, slide more specifically.
G Giovanna21:38
You're not sharing because she stole your screen again, yeah, there you
go.
G Giovanna21:42
Yeah, so, uh, yeah, so, so this segmentation, I'm wondering if there are
any correlations between the segmentation used in CEX and uh and and
campaigns and also the the the strategic segments that were created uh
based on the solutions.
J Judith22:00
Um, well, this, the, the, the, the CX segments that were based on, uh,
first, it was analysis by the analytics team, so the the thewhat is now
part of Fleur's team, the yeah, the DNA, yeah, yeah. So analysts have
made an analysis, but I, you know, I don't have a top of mind how how
they did it, but they have it. And then we did quantitative research to
checkwhat, you know, what is most relevant for consumer customers
and non-customs. um and um therewere organizedworkshops. Linda
has conducted, so this is a project thatLinda has conducted. So there
therewas basically awhole list of potentially relevant needs. Then we
tested it in online quantitative research. Thesewere the and then there
was aworkshop to. To pick the most important ones what is on the one
hand, most important for customers, and on the other hand, something
wewant to liveup to as photo as well. For example, lowest tariffs was
the most important for customers, but for photoall, we are not a prize
fighter, so therefore, within that workshop, it got, you know, it got
deleted. So that, that, you know, this was awholeuh triact, it was a
whole project, and this came out, and then therewereum um how do
you say, a surface blous service promises, and um so we researched
that as well. And after that, flow resulting marketing consultancy club
was hired by Linda and her team, and they did a bigger research on what
is the right wording of these promises.
J Judith24:11
And then this was, this was the end result.
J Judith24:14
Andwe measured that sometimes we've measured it 3times. So that is
this, and that is, this is what wewant to liveup to as desired customer,
you know, experience for our customers.
G Giovanna24:29
OK, so sorry, so these, these 4profiles and these 4customer.
G Giovanna24:35
Segments, um, these are the ones that are that are consideredvaluable
for V and fall. These are the ones that wewant to attract.
J Judith24:45
Uh, this is the desired customer experiencewewant to provide to our
customers, so this is targeted towards customers. These these needs.
OK, OK. This is targeted towards customers. Where is the strategic
segmentation we just talked about. This is what type of customers we
want to attract. So this is saying something about the desired
experience. And the other thing is, who, who, who do wewant to attract.
So yeah, to answer your question, how does this correlate? Well yeah,
there are different things. OK, OK, clear. Yeah, so, so andwe are not at
the point yet, so this is now, I think, as we speak ongoing like also high
withLinda, how to You know, to, yeah, to align.
J Judith25:39
These things brilliant.
G Giovanna25:40
OK, let's let's ask thisfollow-up question for them as well.
J Judith25:45
Yeah, but apart from this, we don't have other segmentation. So in the
past we've done several things, but asfar as I know, this is now the only
The thing and I don't know to what extent this, you know, these four
types of needs are being also usedwithinMCOs, for example, group
acquisition. I don't know.
G Giovanna26:10
OK. And um I remember and um.
G Giovanna26:14
So in the kick off a deck therewas, therewere also quite a few
um slides
about perceptions and insightsfrom uh from previous uhworkshops and
the research that we did in regards to uh attitude towards priceuh
switching contract types but also in regards to macro trends in
switching behavior, brand perception, blah blah blah. Can you takeus
through and explain us a bit what were the highlights, what were the
most important takeaways on on theseuh research pieces?
J Judith26:47
Yeah, and I'm thinkingwhat is most handy too.
G Giovanna26:52
We have, we have a show you, I think this one.
J Judith26:55
Well, I think this is most important.
J Judith27:00
This is somethingum I may just, just for now
because Iwas expecting
this question and there's a lot, so I think it's a bit difficult to, to answer,
butLike thesewere the 4key developments which on which the new
consumer strategy was based on. So key developments are affordability,
sustainability, changing of customers, so you know, more and more
types of solutions and smart innovation like hands. So, and there are a
lot of
underlying slides. So here are, you know, just the the the the. The
titles. So yeah, the energy bill, you know, it keeps on rising and rising.
Also, for example, ETS and other lasting other tax initiatives will lead to
much, much higher tariffs on power energy, so affordability is key and
will be key. And for example, we also see that in that piling, so piling
number 11, number 1213. And then we zoom into that topic, like, OK, you
know, how do you, do you have concerns regarding energy prices? Do
you
follow energy prices? How important is it to you? And so those types
of insights, it's part of, you know, that slide decks I sent you, andwe can
of course go through them, but, but just to help you navigate through
this. That's part of that. Um, well, and Um, let me see. Oh yeah, yeah,
and then one important thingwithin that sustainability topic, yeah, uh,
CNSNL is a key part of photo for sustainability transition. To show you,
it's um.
J Judith28:56
OK.
J Judith28:57
The, the phosphor groups grow emissions.
J Judith29:01
Uh, and C and SNL, well, that's also including B2B, so that's very
important to mention, of course, should be responsible for 80% of this
decline. So he can tell that the strategist can explain you more about
this, but you know, it's huge, the the the.
J Judith29:21
What we need to accomplish by 20that's by 2040, right? Yeah, I think,
yeah, yeah, yeah. And uh so and uh also very important, um, yeah, more
scrutinity of sustainability claims yeah so IM marks, we have it's like a
headache topic, um. Yeah, the people from MCL can explain you much
more about this, but yeah, we arevery, we need to bevery caref
ul in
what we say about sustainability andwhat we can claim or can't claim.
So that's important. And yeah, well, we are eager group is eager and
therefore Netherlands as well, yeah, to do our part in the energy
transition and that's the Clima on BT and that document, it's uh it's on
our website and I can send you the link of course. Uh so that's, that's. I
think the main topics behind those two, and then the changing
customers, that's what I said, like the traditional households no longer
representative, so that's the 60%without a solution at this moment and
the 40%who has one or more solutions and buy solutions, it's
especially heat pump and charging. That will grow and that we are
aiming for because it leads to much higher and consumption but also
but also being there as a strategic service provider for these solutions is
also important, andwhen you say the traditional householdwhile still
large is no longer representative, what what exactly do you mean by
this?
G Giovanna 30:57
Is this, is this a reduction, uh, that is being predicted by 202,030or?
J Judith 31:05
Yeah.
J Judith 31:11
Um, Yeah, so now we havewithin the traditional, we have this, we have
this market share andwewant to keep it. That's the ambition by 2030,
but the high E, the prognosis is that it will, that the number of
households will grow towards 2030from 556households to Over 2
million when it when it comes to heat pump andwhen it comes to EV
home charging, it's also on in Greece.
J Judith 31:46
Does that answer your question? Yeah, yeah, becauseuh he has much
more detailed detailed slides and numbers, but yeah, that's the, that's
the movement, um. So that's, that's on changing customers, I think,
most important, oh yeah, yeah, and, and of course that that that that
presence of those solutions solutions in the home of somebody also
influences their expectations.
J Judith 32:16
um because for example, if you have a heat pump, you have a certain
usage pattern, and I, yeah, well, ifwe as photosile can offer you tailored.
Service on this or a specific energy contract on this, that, that could be
interesting becausewe know
from some research that, you know, those
groups are open to that. So for example, the heat pump research I
emailed you in that, you know, email we discussed about is also uhuh
trying to findways, you know, yeah, find propositions that are And to
check how relevant they are for for people. And now, Within the
customer energy management team, experience management team,
Focal Hausa, together with Brus and from the solution development
team, is also now checking together with Gabbio, so so responsible for
the pricing and sourcing. Uh, what exactly, what type of type of
use
propositions can we offer to, uh, yeah, to high to several highe groups,
um, but that's, that's really on the EEG domain, right, in terms of how do
we Yeah, yeah, yeah, but we are looking on that domain to, to, you know,
to, to, to check ifwe can differentiateuhuh towards the different
strategic groups by offering different types of contracts, mostly based
on time of
use. So that is a project, but also, yeah, that solution
development, that's that's another part of the.
J Judith 34:09
The, the, the, the puzzlewhen you, you know, when you look at the Uh,
this, I mean, yeah, yeah, this part, I thinkRabang has a has a question.
R Raban 34:20
Yes, thank you. It is very interesting, um, uh, question about the previous
slide, um, yeah, what, what would you say Vattenfall is currently doing in
terms of, uh, acquisition strategies, um, to, um, yeah, work towards
these different expectationsfor different, um, uh, solutions and, and.
combinations of offerings that peopleuse in their homes because you
just explained there's a project ongoing, but it still in exploration is
currently doing anything or would you say that's going to happen in the
f
uture? We're not doing it yet. Yeah, I don't know.
J Judith 34:59
I don't know much about that. That's more than the or from strategy,
you know that I can't, I think.
J Judith 35:09
We, we don't do it, but I think they, uh, pluscobone maybe you spoke to
him and answer this better, yeah, OK.
G Giovanna 35:20
Can we, can we, um, can you explain the last, the last two bits here in
the in the slide?
J Judith 35:26
Yeah, yeah, when it comes to that, that, that fourth domain, the key
development, that that's, that's that smart innovation, um.
J Judith 35:37
So, yeah, uh let me see. Yeah, so we developed, for example, stra boiler.
It's it's an e-boiler attached to um solar panels. Yeah, so that's
something, you know, that that is actually a solution we did develop a
spotfall, but that's not the, the, yeah, we, wewant to do morewith
partners. But yeah, that's a solution in order to um Yeah, uh, uh, help
f
ulfill a need because the, the, the, the so dealings, it will, you know, it
will end. So there are peoplewho have a lot of solar panels and they are
interesting in how to, yeah, to store electricity or what, what to do with it
in order to prevent having to pay extra costs. So, so yeah, we, and also
you have the, the grids. So this is also it's. This type of initiative is
meeting needs of some groups, a strategic group, on one hand and on
the other hand, maybe it is also Um, uh, uh, helping in, in another, yeah,
the model, you know, and, and helping like a tenant or, you know, the net
in keeping a balancedwrit. But I don't know in detail about this. This is
more a strategic project, but but that's the, no, that's the kind of the line
of thinking. And yeah, so and that Iwas talking about.
J Judith 37:16
You have different laws, yeah, yeah, you have a new law.
J Judith 37:23
I forgot the name, but it makes it possible for to me it all these
abbreviations. Uh, well, it's, it's about being able to stand in direct
contact with the customer. Uh, I don't know all the details about it, but
Yeah, he knows about this, but it's, it's a, it's a threat and a chance,
both. These new political. Development Yeah, sorry, clear, yeah.
G Giovanna 38:02
I don't know. No, it's probably because I'm really warm. I don't know
why.
J Judith 38:07
Yeah, and, and, and yeah, so ifwe do more in this, yeah, we can help
people more and uhwe can, yeah, well, just to put it not nicely, but to
lock in customers, yeah, well, ifwe, ifwe are able to offer more services,
becoming a strategic partner, yeah, OK.
R Raban 38:25
One question earlier you told us indeed that this the home service
domain. Uh, will be a tricky one because, um, indeed the, the physical
assets you're looking mainly to partners, uh, to, to do that and also the
software and in the digital, uh, side, yeah, Fox is not a big IT player or
tech company. So, so what actually do you see in terms of a role or
offerings, uh, to be that central player and have the contact and the
customer relationship uh and own that as well? What, what could you
make it a bit more tangiblewhat you see there?
J Judith 39:00
Um, yeah, well, uh, by focusing on, on, for example, peoplewho have a
home charging point and an electric car, and ifwe are then able to offer
one contract, um, both for charging the car and charging the home. Um,
and, um, be able to uh optimize that. So, so it's also offering services or
monitoring or maintenance, uh, those types of things. Um, yeah, we,
that is the That is the f
uturewherewe should, you know, um, try to make
uhuh.
J Judith 39:45
Try to be f
utureproof and um be able to f
ulfill those needs. Um, and in a
way, weum It is realistic for for our level of IT.
J Judith 40:03
Competence, so not being able to be a new Google Home or whatever,
not not to go in that direction. But to focus on the charging and home.
J Judith 40:15
Yeah, energy part.
J Judith 40:20
Exactly more in he can because he has done that project, he can explain
more. Yeah, thanks.
G Giovanna 40:27
Um, yeah, I have a few last questions around, um, the, theupcoming or
the, the increasing needs and switching behaviors and a bit of a brand
perception as well becausewe saw quite a few items in terms of
uhwhat
are theunmet needs, uh, this shift uh towards affordability. What are
your takeaways andwhat what are your learnings about these, um, how
is that being perceived? What is, uh, its competit uh competitive
advantage? How is it seen by the market? I think these are researches
that were also held by you.
J Judith 41:08
Yeah, yeah, yeah, indeed plus that record.
J Judith 41:14
So there there's also valuable information in that I think. Yeah, we see
that price is very important and price has become more important since
the energy crisis a couple of years ago in combination with the
affordability that's been more, yeah, more key. Topic as as we
discussed, but it also translates to more focus on prices, more focus on
following price developments, so that's that's very important and um.
Um, other needs, yeah, you know, having insights, having, having control
on energy usage, that's very important, having the feeling that you're
not being screwed over to say Frank. That, that's important we see in
different uhuh researchers, um. I think those and and then for some
people, it's also more that help with becoming more sustainable to to
make a more sustainable home. So, so yeah, that that depends on, of
course, the houseuh household situation and uh of people. Um.
G Giovanna 42:28
Yeah, abo, any questions?
R Raban 42:30
Yeah, so thanks you it's interesting indeed, and I recognizewhat you're
saying. Um, uh, wondering, uh, to what extent you also see, um, um,
unmet needs or unmet pain points at customers. So there's currently not
a player yet that offers something that is uh a need or a pain point at the
customers could also be more in the f
uture. Uh do you have any, any
ideas on that, um.
J Judith 42:56
No, that's, that's, of course, if I, uh, if I knew that would be great, but
that's that's the billion dollar question.
J Judith 43:05
That's, that's one of the, you know, of the topics, of course, what I
showed like herewith, you know, the trivial things that need to be filled
in and these these things. Um, yeah, so, so part of this is indeed, um
getting more insight into pains, gains and jobs to be done of each of
these strategic segments in order and then of course, also link it to
competition and Of course, we do know some things, uh, which is in the
Q2brand tracker I uh I I I I sent to you. And there you can see, for
example, like on a brand attribute like is leading, leading towards a more
sustainable f
uture. Yeah, you see how we score and you see how other
brands score and then for example, with all these types of sustainability
type of claims, you see that green choice is the number one associated
with dominates this discussion, yeah. Yeah, yeah. So, andwhen it comes
to low tariffs, yeah, well, never thought to fall is is performingwell. So
yeah, it's, it's a challenge in how to get that perception less.
G Giovanna 44:24
So for the two, so what you're saying, so your your output here isfor the
two main criteria of choice, which are price and uh And the sustainability
or energy transition, uh, Vattenfa doesn't score first in any of them.
J Judith 44:41
Yeah, well, that's um.
J Judith 44:44
Yeah, yeah, there are so many attributes, so I can, you know, I can uh get
the report. Where is it? Where is it? I thinkwe have a slide here that
might beum.
G Giovanna 44:57
That we also printed out based on.
R Raban 45:01
Yeah, I'll share it, um, one moment, but yeah, indeed there's a lot of so
the research documents are super extensive, a lot of, uh, indeed or
scope, different scopings, at least we got this one.
J Judith 45:15
Oh yeah, this is, uh, I see on the the the style it isflowing. Yeah.
J Judith 45:22
Yeah.
J Judith 45:24
So I, I don't know this one, I think. OK, OK, maybe this is something from
the, I think so I think so. Oh, Which, yeah, because I don't recognize this
one. I only recognized the letter type and I thought it was. flow resulting
He's.
G Giovanna 45:53
There's also this, uh, yeah, theuh the customer promises, but I think this
is more of a strategic document. I'm I'm I'm I'm cautious of time here.
Um, I think you did, um, thanksfor takingus throughwithuh your entire
patienceuh and explaining a bit of the the main strategic um decks and
slides that wewent through. Uh, really appreciate this. Um, is there just,
just to sum up and to wrap up this conversation, um, moving forward,
um, you, I think you're aware of, uh, the scope of this project. So as
mentioned before, we're doing, um, some exploration now, doing a lot
of, um, interviews internally, but then externally as well, scanning
through all the documents. We have quite a few one that one's, um,
quite a few that we haven't yet yet scanned, but we need to deep dive a
bit more. Uh, so we're extracting insights and then of course, creating
um new revenue streams, potential growth avenues, improvements on
the channels and so on. So moving forward and uh of course gaining
traction and becominguh having this as a strategic project, what are
your advice? What is your advice for us moving forward and how to be
successf
ul with this piece? Becauseum one of the things that we see is
there's a lot of, there are many initiatives running in parallel, right? Um,
how can we gain traction and how can we gain attention to this piece,
understanding that this is gonna be gonna be this is going to be
contributing to this ambition of attracting new customers and so on.
G Giovanna 47:34
So yeah, yeah, yeah, as you said, there are a lot of initiatives parallel.
J Judith 47:39
And um I, since I'm not a strategist, I don't have the overview of the
what, you know, I know about some of them, but not all. So therefore, I
would strongly recommend you to talk to my manager, Sven or talk to.
Yeah, yeah, because they know much more about.
J Judith 48:01
But you know what all addition initiatives that are going on. So I think it's
for me it's difficult to answer the question, um, apart from this
comments.
G Giovanna 48:14
Brilliant. OK, we're gonna, we're gonna involve them more and more.
We're already in touchwith them, which is also extremely helpf
ul. But,
uh, thank you so much for your time. Yeah, you'rewelcome. I hope,
yeah, voucher.
W Wouter 48:29
Yeah, you can ask one more question regarding the segment. So indeed,
so yeah, I have the ENG segment which is 60% right, and part of it is,
uh, yeah, not too interested in making.
J Judith 48:44
Or because no money or no part of part of it might be potential
customersfor that.
W Wouter 48:51
Do you have data to predict how
big that size is compared to the other?
J Judith 48:56
Therefore, it was like the 59.
J Judith 48:59
You know, on top of the two groups. No, no, and if there are any, you
know, any thoughts on that, he is the one because he has made this,
yeah, OK, because this is very key for us.
G Giovanna 49:16
OK. Brilliant, thanks so much, Judith. uh you a great day and thank you
so much for making the time. Yeah, bye-bye.
W Wouter 49:25
Bye bye.


**Remco (Value steering)**

R Raban 0:01
Thanks good deal um. Yeah, so we already had to kick off of coursewe
got to know each other a little bit, um. But uh still curious to know a bit
more about your role, so maybe you can tell us a bit more on that and
also um meanwhile reflecting also on the strategy of in the CN domain.
So where, where is your focus andwherewhere are your priorities? And
we're also curiousfor your team what KPIs, you're being measuredd
again. So if you could also include that in in your story, then yeah.
R Remco 0:36
Um, OK, my story is this, uh, I started about 16years ago.
R Raban 0:47
Time flies. I remember. Oh, this one.
R Remco 0:48
Is it good or bad news? Um, and I started in the finance department as a
business controller.
R Remco 0:56
Um, but after a few years, uh, I think about, um, 78years ago, uh, no. I
started differently. When I came here at noon the states, um, um, the
marketing sales department was only looking at the sales numbers, only
numbers, no value or costs, only numbers. So that was quite a
challenge. So in my controller period, um, I reported then, uh, the cost
Saved Share EditableRemco (Value steering) G F
Browse Upgrade
Search or ask anything G
per channel. So what are the costs if, if you acquirevia door to door or
via online. Um, but then after a few years, um, another step had to be
made is that wewould like to look at customer value. So what is the
value of the customers we acquired, but that was totally new, totally
different, um, and that was a totally new rolewithin the marketing
department. Um, so I f
ulfilled. Then I f
ulfilled this role, and it's still my
role. It's the role of managing customer value management, and that
means that my responsibility is that I have to monitor and evaluate, um,
arewe creatingvaluewith the campaigns we're doing on. Existing
customers and on prospects, acquisition campaigns.
R Remco 2:26
And thevalue pers perspective is that we are looking at what are the
costs of acquiring or retaining customers andwhat are the benefits, the
margins, the fixed fees, etc. andweuse anMPV calculation, NPV
calculation, uh, to evaluate that.
R Remco 2:49
Um, and, uh, we have, uh, in the meantime, a lot of reports, NPC reports,
uh, which report, uh, yeah, the, the gain value per customer, per
channel, per campaign, etc.
R Remco 3:07
So my, my, the core business of my role is, uh, uh, yeah, evaluate the
valueuhwe are creating. But next to that, yeah, I do a lot of more things.
I'm also involved in business planning because I have a finance
background, so I have a lot of connection with the finance department
about business planning, KPI setting for the marketing sales
department, forecasting for the sourcing and the pricing for our
commodities. Um, but I'm also involved in, in, um, different projects. Uh,
for example, um, a couple of years ago we had an energy crisis, so, uh,
therewere no, uh, marketing campaigns anymore, uh, but then, um, um.
R Remco 3:58
On a certain moment, the campaigns will be restarted and I managed a
project of
being ready for the restart of marketing campaigns. Uh, last
month Iwas involved in a project, uh, for our, um, uh, above the line
campaign, the commercial, uh, with, uh, the, thewind, uh, uh,
proposition. And my rolewas, uh, yeah, creating thewind proposition uh
together withuh another department CIO. Maybe you've heard of that
department, that's the department responsible for the sourcing and
pricing of the products. Um, so I'm also doing, um, different projects,
one-off project actually. Um, one last thing, um, last year Iwas, uh, um,
as a temporary role, uh, the product owner for our customer for life
team, and there's a team responsible for retaining and, uh, uh. Extending
the contracts of existing customers, uh, because the, the existinguh
product owner left us and therewas nobody, um, so I uh I f
ulfilled that
role for here now that there's a new product owner and.
R Remco 5:17
She's doing it well, so I can focus on other things now. So it's the core
business is customer value management, but I do a lot of other things
next to that because at the moment I don't need all my time for that
customer value management.
R Raban 5:34
And so, so thanksfor elaborating on this. Have you in the past also been
involved in projects with a similar scope like this wherewe also look
beyond the improvement of the channels and the tactics also look more
strategically into new offerings and new commercial conversationsfor
customers and then thevalue estimate of that. Have you been doing
that as well?
R Remco 5:56
Yeah, a couple of years ago I think it's maybe. 67years ago the Uh, it
wasMcKinsey was doing a analysis on that, yeah, and Iwas also
involved in that. That's quite some time ago implemented? Not really. It
was more the confirmation when you are on the right way and there are
some minor modifications, but it was a different time then. We now see a
big shift in customer behavior. Actually from the offline channels to the
online channel. Yeah, that was in that time it was a real difference, yeah,
yeah, that maybe also brings me into this overview
um.
R Raban 6:45
We arewondering that this is of course the strategy of currently what is
your perspective on the opportunities that hasfor within this in this
strategic direction and I'm mainly also curious about new new
propositions and new offerings that that could be interesting to explore.
R Remco 7:08
Yeah, I know this. Iwas also involved in the preparation of the the this
strategy direction. And uh actually uhuh an important takeout, um, from
our group, but also from the, the, the management team from, from
Cindy Crow was that um, We at Falten are not good in selling hardware
actually, so selling solutions, uh, solar panels, we are not really capable
of scalingup the business and make a good profit of it. Um, so that's
why the arrow is a little bit, uh, yeah, up right that we should actually
focus more on the services behind that, not, not on really on the
hardware. We should source it out to parties who are good in it like they
are good in it. Let them do it. Uh, andwe are good in, uh, yeah, other
things like, um, commodity sourcing and pricing and, uh, yeah, think of
different propositions.
R Remco 8:19
So that's actually the basic of that slide that hardware selling is not our
business actually.
R Raban 8:26
Yeah, OK.
R Raban 8:29
And and talking about the the degree of consumer targeting from
general to specific, I'm also wonderinguh from avalue perspective, to
what extent, um. Yeah, what improvements were made over the past
years andwhat are maybe now also important initiatives that are
ongoing to do a better job.
R Remco 8:50
What we also discussed in the kickoff meeting is that the traditional
electricity and gas customer is a little bit, um, yeah, decreasing in
number, um.
R Remco 9:04
I think Swan told you that uh in 2030or maybe2035, I don't know when
exactly uhwe are looking at a lot of different target groups, not only the
the ENG customer but also the customer with electricvehicle, solar and
heat pump, etc. There's there are, I think, a couple of 32or 35different
target groups we have to, uh, yeah, we have to maintain.
R Remco 9:34
Um, but from avalue perspective, this customer, the traditional ENG
customer, uh, yeah, uh, realizes a lot ofvalue, yeah, our normal, normal
value, uh, level actually. And the question is, how can we gain that the
same or maybe morevalue on those other target groups with, for
example, only electricity and no gas. So we are missing then the gas
profits and the gasfix fee, but how can we gain another type of profits
or margin from that electricity only customer. So that's quite a
challenge, and there are talks about um offering services to these types
of customers or servicewith a monthly revenue on it, like a home energy
management surface or a solar panel surface or a heat pump
maintenance service, that kind of things. The trick here is to gain a
recurring revenue and not only one off
but in recurring revenue and
that's the customer lifetimevalue that will that will result in a higher
customer lifetimevalue and that's where something like he comes in,
yeah, yeah, yeah, but then, then and I'm not surewhat exactly the
direction is. Arewe the party uh installing the hands? Or is that the
hardware part and it's a partner of
us we'll do that andwe are only
offering the services behind the hands and then how the hands interact
with the daily prices or the hourly prices, etc.
R Remco 11:37
I'm not sure about the detail of that.
R Raban 11:40
I couldn't maybe a software software proposition.
R Raban 11:46
Talking about the customer segments, maybeum quickly go into this
one.
R Raban 11:52
yeah, Iwas wondering if you're you're already talking a bit about uh
recurring revenues. I, Iwas wondering how, how do you define avaluable
customer, uh, what is avaluable customer to to you?
R Raban 12:05
Yeah, when we talk about acquisition, yeah, when we talk about
acquisition, uhweuhweum.
R Remco 12:13
Evaluate that on two KPIs. What is the NPV, the NPV for that customer,
and it should be higher than 0because if thevalue of the customer is
below zero, it doesn't addvalue.
R Remco 12:32
So you shouldn't acquire or retain that customer, andwe're looking at a
period of 10years in the f
uture. So it's expected actually it's expected
value. So that expectedvalue should be higher than 0. And the second
one is the payback period should bewithin 3or 4or 5years because if
you acquire a customer against high costs or high discounts. But the
MPV is about 0.
R Remco 13:06
It's about€10. OK, that's that's value, but the payback period is 9years,
then you bear a large risk because it's an expectedvaluewith expected
parameters.
R Remco 13:21
So if one thing in your expectedvalue is in actual. It's different because
for example the churn is higher than than you expected. Yeah, then the
MPVwill go down and your payback periodwill be longer than 9years.
G Giovanna 13:38
But uh but you mentioned, um, so you. I think the overall um. rationale
behind is you need to pay back before before this discussion leaves,
right, and the shortest payback you have, the highest value combined
with the, that's true andwe don't evaluate on customer lifetimevalue,
but weuse an average.
R Remco 14:12
For example, we look at averageMP fees, and in that average
calculation, there's an expected churn. Added. You can also turn that
around to an expected customer lifetime. But we areusing the chur uh
as a measure.
R Remco 14:33
OK, yeah, yeah, so for a group of 100customers we have an estimated
churn, uh, for example, after 1year 20% is left after 2years, uh, 30% is
left, etc. until 10years and after 10years, uh, maybe 70% has left. But
based on that curve, we are calculating the NPV and the germ
prediction, what is that based on what variables? Yeah, that's our DNA
data analytics team is responsible for the curves. And they um um they
these are based on historical data. But that'sfor now it's difficult. I'll
explain that later. But they actually they look backum on different um
levels. The churn is, for example, um evaluated on the channel of
acquisition price comparison site customers have a far way higher churn
than door to door customers, customers who we are quite fire door to
door. So it's differentiated by channel, acquisition channel, that's the
one. The second one is, is it a supply switch customer or a moving
customer that also differsfor if it's a supply supplier switch a switch
from one energy supplier to the other one. We call that the supplier
switch.
R Remco 16:17
for usage and if
um someone you say it's differentiated by acquisition
channel, does that mean if for for example, if someone, uh, visits uh or
goes to thewebsite throughum programmatic display banner.
R Remco 16:36
Then comes back through a price comparison website. It's the last point
of touch that matters, right? Not not everything that happens before that
in the journey. Thewish is there, yeah, but it's very complicated to to
have that. Yeah, yeah, we look at the last channel, yeah last touch
channel. Um, so, uh, acquisition channel, uh, kind of switch type, is it a
moving customer becausewe know that the customer who who is
moving, um, has a lower churn than the customer who switchesfrom the
one supplier to the other supplier. The other one is the discount level.
We know that customers we acquirewith a high discount has also higher
chance. So we're also evaluating the discount level and it's quite simple.
Is it lower or higher than€100something like that.
R Remco 17:34
Um, And the tune is evaluated per quarter. So, uh, and, and it's, yeah, we
look back, uh about 5years. And then the last 5yearsfor theMPV
because theMPV is about this is that 10year period is estimated.
R Remco 17:54
But This works uhuntil the energy crisis, because, uh, yeah, wewe had
doneuh actually theuh. The market was quite stable. And it was a good
uhuh predictor for f
uture. But then the energy crisis came and then uh
every supplier, uh, yeah, restarted their uh campaigns. So we, um, miss,
we are missing some data now
because if you look back from now 5
years, 5years back, yeah, there is awhole period, about 2years that
almost no customer returns so that's, uh, yeah, quite a challenge and uh
our DNA colleagues are now, um, yeah, modeling something to
overcome that.
R Remco 18:47
But yeah, that's, that'sfor now the challenge actually a little bit of a
problem. Um, so we, we are restarted the last year andwe now
uh
tracking the churn, um, but we can only look one year back.
R Remco 19:02
Andwe see that for price comparison sites now, it's almost the same
churn pattern pattern. So I think no major changes uh are there.
R Remco 19:15
But the channel, um, acquisition channel mix has changed a lot, but you
know that because that's why we are sitting here. But I think the churn
itself, um, no, it it. Uh, hasn't really changed and, uh, only looking one
year back, yeah, OK.
R Raban 19:36
Um, talking about the, the, the segments, so you you just explain to us
what avaluable, valuable customer is. Um, yeah, could you tell us a bit
more on, uh, uh, about the segments that, that you see as, as valuable?
Um, andwhat do we know about these, these groups or thesewhat
what defines them, um, and. In terms of profitability and on the other
hand, also if you have aview on that, how easy it is to attract them to
become a new customer for looking from a failure perspective, um, there
are some drivers um which areuh successf
ul failure and and one more
important driver is.
R Remco 20:20
the level of margin we are creating on the customer and that is
influenced by theusage of gas and electricity. So a customer with a high
usage of electricity and gas creates more margin for us and this has a
higher value. That's an important one, so highusage is highvalue. Uh,
the second one is a churn. Low churn is highvalue. So that's actually the
2nd 1and the 3rd 1. Is the investment we have to make to uh gain or to
retain a customer. So if that investment is high, for example, a door to
door channel, which is quite expensive channel with discounts. Uh,
yeah, uh, creates, um, lower value than an online channel, um, with no
discounts or a small discount onatanel site, for example. So there are 3
main drivers, uh, of, um, yeah, that determine the success or, or the, the
high, uh, the, the, the rate of failure you're creating, uh. Usage Um, turn
and investment per customer.
G Giovanna21:37
To attract or retain.
R Remco 21:39
Both, yeah, and, andwhat do you
what what what do you see in terms of
segments that um that contribute a lot to these three?
R Raban 21:49
metrics or so what defines them? Are are they living in specific places?
Are they, do they have a certain type of
behavior? What do we know
about these these customers that perform well on what you just
explained?
R Remco 22:01
For exquisition, uh, the most valuable customers are moving customers.
Customer, customer who moves to a new house, uh, needs a quick and
energy contract, goes to.
R Remco 22:17
And uh thinks, oh, this product is good, it's a standard PP product
without discount or avariable product, and uh he moved to a large
housewith a lot of
usage.
R Remco 22:30
For example, that that's avery
very
valuable customer, yeah, yeah.
G Giovanna22:34
And um, do you see any correlations in regards to? Geography in the
sense of regions in the Netherlands, whether that's moreurban, uh, we
see this behavior more in theurban or in a rural area.
R Remco 22:50
No, I, I maybe our DNA colleagues. Can evaluate that, but I on the data
set I have and I looked at it on different times. I don't see big differences
in regions in the past, in the past when the price comparison site Halich
started, we saw that in the region of Groningen where the founder lives.
Uh, therewere a lot of more switches than, uh, uh, elsewhere in the
Netherlands, but that's now a lot of years ago. Now it's everywhere
actually. Yeah, important thing is that, um, our, uh, daughter company
Delta.
R Remco 23:36
is located in Zeeland and they see a big difference, difference between
customers living in Zeeland. They are traditional. They don't switch more
often and their customer base outside Zeeland, and that's actually the
average of the Netherlands just switching customers 15% per year. But
that's in in that company, there's a a big difference.
R Remco 24:10
Original base is not original base and in the beginning at Nuon we saw
also a little bit that affect original Nuon area, those customers stayed a
little bit more than the not Newon area. But that's 1520years ago and
we don't see that that that doesn't count anymore.
G Giovanna24:34
And uhwhen it comes to types of households, age, income, is there any
other correlations that you see there? No, no, um, the hypothesis was
that younger people switching more than elderly people, but that's not
true.
R Remco 24:52
elderly people are switching. Um, what we see the last, what we saw last
year is that, um, in our case, uh, peoplewith a higher consumption
switched more. They, they had something to gain and they switched for
example to dynamic price contracts.
R Remco 25:14
Uh, wewere quite, uh, late in offering a dynamic price contract. So in the
time before, yeah, those types of customers, they switched away to Aba.
R Remco 25:26
To yeah, A Bay, yeah, yeah, for example, it really hard to get them back
as well.
R Remco 25:32
Yeah, but is it still the case?
G Giovanna25:36
Is it still relevant to to switch to uh price dynamic?
G Giovanna25:42
Is it?
G Giovanna25:44
I mean, do we still see this uh this uh pattern happening, but not not
very dominant.
R Remco 25:52
There are of course still switching peoplewith a higher usage to
dynamic contracts, but it's not our largest competitor now.
R Raban 26:05
Um, and I've got another question on on this overview, so um. You just
explainedwhat profitability means and also you explained some patterns
that you seewherewherewewherewhere customers are more
attractiveum for thought and thought to be acquired. Um, talking about
this overview and uhwhat are then at this point the most profitable
segments, um, and, and, and our second question here isfor the
upcoming two years, where do you think, uh, yeah, the most opportunity
for acquisition growth could appear?
R Remco 26:40
Yeah.
R Remco 26:41
Um, I think, uh, do you also have an interview with, uh, for example, von
Mer from ourcavio department or some something from his team,
because this question is also relevant for them to ask or actually relevant
for you, but they can also give you some.
R Remco 27:07
Yeah, I can also ask Paul or Wilo to give that connection or to inform
them, but I think for this specific question it's also good to to ask them
because they are also looking or they are especially looking at the
sourcing side of the customer value.
R Remco 27:31
We, I, andwe are from marketing, we are only looking at the margin side
and fixed fee side, but there's also a lot more of that, and that's the
sourcing side. And I'll come to that later because at the moment the
most valuable customers are left up the traditional electricity and gas
customers. Wewe gain margin from the commodity but also fixed fee on
electricity and gas and our margin.
R Remco 28:03
Uh, policy is that we are slightly increasing the fixed fee, uh, becausewe
are seeing that um theusage of on the commodity is uh a little bit
lowering.
R Remco 28:17
So that works a little bit, but Yeah, this type of customer, the traditional
electricity and gas customer, uh, gains morevalue than only electricity,
electricity customer. Yeah, that that's the truth.
R Raban 28:34
And you mentioned also the high EU is important and is that not typically
something that appears in the in the other segments as well, for
example, someone that has electricvehicle. Yeah, yeah, that, that's true.
R Remco 28:49
Uh, so that's also interesting. I think that's the, the, the next interesting,
uh, segment, the, the customer with and high electricity, uh, usage,
yeah, and, um.
R Remco 29:03
With or without solar panels, that's difficult because there are from
politics some change change policy about that or the policy will change
and it's quiteunknown what the direction will be that differs heavily.
R Remco 29:25
What kind of policy wewill have on solar panels and the the fee the
consumers will receive. Uh, and thevaluewe are, uh, realizing on that
type of customer, so.
R Remco 29:42
Now at the moment with the current policy.
R Remco 29:47
It'sOK for highe customers to have solar panelsfor our value, yeah, we
gain a little bit less value, but it's not avery big difference. But for
example, if the Saldisrelingwill disappear andwe can't. Um Uh, use the
truckle cost anymore, then uh it's avalue hit, yeah. Yeah, but That's not
sure if that the direction will be. But for now.
G Giovanna 30:21
But it's so it's uncertain at this point.
R Remco 30:23
That's very uncertain, very uncertain, yeah, yeah, yeah.
R Remco 30:29
But for the f
uture, the, I think the next most valuable customer is the
customer withuh a single product, a singleuh electricity and a service
withuh a recurringuh fee. Yeah, yeah, that's the ambition to grow there,
yeah, yeah, yeah, but still unclear what kind of surfaces that will be.
Yeah, there are some sounds about uhum heat pump maintenance
surfaces, for example, but also the the hem as a surface or the the the
maintenance or the theuh.
R Remco 31:11
Maybewe are the conductor or the director of the hams. I don't know
that that could be a servicewith a monthly fee, that kind of things and
that's also part of our assignment of course to to figure that out in more
detail.
R Raban 31:27
So I understand about the question where to. Focus on to for acquisition
we can talk also to to some other, uh, people, um, and, and based on
your personal, uh, perspective, um, uh, what, what defines you think the
customer segments wherewe can make the most impact in terms of
acquisition over the next two years, but, uh, what defines these
segments?
R Raban 31:53
So, so on the one handwe have profitability, but we are also because
our focus is really on acquisition, also very interested in who are the
easy ones to to acquire and to convince to switch to Vodafone. Do we
have any perspective on that? Do we know anything about those those
customers, potential customers?
R Remco 32:12
Yeah, what I can say about that is that customers who only look at the
price. Um, yeah, they, uh, Faal is not the cheapest one in the market, but
we are also not, uh. Um, the, the expensive one in the market, we're a bit
a little bit in the middle, but the consumers who are really only looking at
the price. Yeah, we are not interesting for them, but customers who, uh.
We are also keen on trustworthy or services. We have a lot of services,
for example, when your monthly payment install payment is too low
based on your usage, you get a signal from us an email. Uh, yeah, that
kind of services, so peoplewho are, um, keen on that kind of services,
yeah, they could be better off, uh, by fault or phone, yeah.
R Remco 33:19
But the price only customers, yeah, we can acquire them, for example,
via price price comparison sites, but after a year they are gone of course
after a year we don't have the lowest price anymore and they are
seeking for the lowest price in the market and that's that's somewhere
else and then you end up negative. But then we are endingup negative,
yeah, yeah, we know that from the 100customers acquired by the price
comparison site that at the end about 85% still is customer at after 10
years. So with that calculation we are still gainingvalue on the average,
but specifically on the group who left us after a year, we are losing.
G Giovanna 34:11
So, so, so sorry, what we're saying is that currently you have the data
that ifwe acquire 100, 100customers through price comparison
websites, so after 10years, 85of them are still left 15% is left, that's left
of
uh still, still, yeah, estate in the yeah, yeah.
R Remco 34:38
So on that 50%, uhwe gain a lot ofvalue.
R Remco 34:42
On the group leaving after 1or 2years.
G Giovanna 34:47
Is this worth it? And the average is, does it make sense to still be in
those prices? Of course they are, of course, yes, they are addingvalue,
so that that's makes it worth it.
R Remco 35:00
But um uh payback period is quite long, so therewe bear a lot of risk on
this group, um, but for the, the target on base stabilization. It adds value,
yeah, but it's not our uh.
R Remco 35:18
Preferred channel, of course, the preferred channel is gaining them by
our own website, for example, becausewe know that the churn is lower
because price compariticides are triggering the customers after 9
months. Oh, look for new
uh contracts on our site. Yeah, so they are
triggered and then uh a lot of them are left.
P4 Participant 4 35:42
How do you balance that? It's a really a manual process where you see,
OK, we're a bit behind target now, OK.
P4 Participant 4 35:50
Get more through price comparison, we have to balance that on several
things.
R Remco 35:58
We have to look at what is our position on the price comparison website
because the position results in. And level of inflow, yeah. Um, but the
position is determined by the level of discount you're adding in your
offer. Andwe have a maximum on that. So ifwe are on the max, but our
position is still the 10th. Yeah, we can add more discounts, but then uh
the, the, the, theMPVwill be negative on the average of the group, um.
You can also say, OK, but we offer the sameum proposition on fat.
R Remco 36:47
and also with€300discount. But also existing customers are on our
website and are seeing that position so that could trigger a turn on our
existing customers.
R Remco 37:05
While if an existing customer goes to a price comparison site, he fills in
my current supplier Spot. So, uh, he doesn't see that on the list. So he
doesn't see the€300discount on the price competitive side.
R Remco 37:22
So that's another thingwe have to balancewhat will the proposition do
on our existing customer base, but how often do you evaluate that and
then turn different levers to adjust that acquisition mix, so to say? Yeah,
we evaluate that not every day, but for example, every month, 2months,
OK. Uh, and it's also a little bit of testing, maybe Wro mentioned it, uh,
we're not testingwith a quiteuh high discount, uh, proposition on our
website. Andwe are testing it, uh, how will it work out for existing
customers? Do they actually see it? Do they react on it or? Do they
accept it? That's also a scenario they accept that uh for if you are new,
then you get a lot of discount. Um Yeah, so that's a test ofwhat's what's
running now. Well, I think maybe it's it stopped due to our ATL campaign,
but it was just for peoplewho, uh, visit thewebsite through SEO or
organic, not through price comparison websites. No, no, yeah, SEO
organic, yeah, yeah, yeah.
R Raban 38:35
Mm Any more questions right now on that topic is speed really the name
of the game and agility to, yeah, OK, our mix is shifting, our value is
decreasing.
P4 Participant 4 38:49
We, we've gained a lot through price comparison website. We need
more from our own channels.
P4 Participant 4 38:56
How is that going? I, I can imagine that that's really juggling and, and,
and, uh, a big challenge.
R Remco 39:04
Yeah it is yeah.
P4 Participant 4 39:06
Do you think there's room for improvement there to gain more control,
maybe predict earlier where you're heading towards.
P4 Participant 4 39:15
Having an intervention, shifting budgets towards your own channels
instead of PCs or the other way around.
R Remco 39:21
I think the main challenge is how to copewith our existing customer
base.
R Remco 39:26
usef
ul as an acquisition channel, that'sfine.
R Raban 39:32
But what Can we offer or what is our story to our existing customers
who arevisiting too they see they see the discount of 30s.
R Remco 39:43
Why am I not getting that? I'm a 10years member of.
R Raban 39:51
Yeah it's a fair point, right?
R Remco 39:53
It is, it is, and you can explain we have life loan discount 25% discount
on your electricity tariff, and if you, um, yeah. Accumulate that over
years your discount is higher than the€300but it's though it's a quite a
difficult story to explain. I can imagine that there's loyalty programs
involved. We have saving points and then you can order something in in
theweb
for free. So we have, we have those, those things, but people
are more focused on the price after the energy crisis than before, so
price is much more important, um, yeah, and they uh they are easily
gone, yeah, so that's the big difference on our website as as an
acquisition channel.
R Remco 40:51
Uh, yeah, what is the balance between, uh, not, uh, scaring off existing
customers but be attractive enough to gain new customers?
R Remco 41:02
And I know there is some recognition, uh, I think, uh.
R Remco 41:07
50or 60% of thevisitors are recognized as a customer. Uh, so they are
rerouted to another page or they, they don't see the acquisition offered,
but it's not uh quiteuhwater resistant, um.
R Remco 41:22
So yeah, it's still a challenge, yeah, yeah, and um one more question uh
from my side.
R Raban 41:29
So, um, talking about acquisition uh strategies, I also saw this slide so
acquisition and retention strategy should take different behavior needs
andwants. Of the segment into account. Um, yeah, to, to what extent do
you see in acquisition strategies that is currently applies, so what is
doing to tailor acquisition strategies based, based on the segments?
Would you tell us a bit more about that? That's a broad question, but,
yeah, yeah, you can only tailor it uh on uh the offer you uh.
R Remco 42:07
You have the proposition for a specific target group and the channel
you're in. And on the proposition side, we have some propositionsfor
specific target groups. For example, we have. Time price, price, and
that's specific for the electric uhvehicleuh target group. And that
proposition is uh on specific time blocks even overnight, you have avery
low tariff, so then it's attractive to uh charge your car.
R Remco 42:45
Um We also have a dynamic price and dynamic price is interesting for
thosewho can a little bit steer their usage to the cheaper moments of
the day, yeah, and then it's actually, yeah, that's it actually. Then we
have a fixed price andvariable price, but that's not really connected to a
specific solution. We areum uh. And now looking at a proposition for
heat pump customers, but that's very, very difficult because heat pump
customers have avery uhum. Uh, andvery, yeah, how do I say it, they
have another um usage pattern than the average customer. Their usage
is in thewinter 24hours. Uh, while, uh, traditional customer, uh, yeah,
has a specific seasonal pattern in theusage. So then, uh, the sourcing of
energy comes in. Uh, we are sourcing on the averageuh curve, but
those, uh, heat pump customers have a different curve. Um, so it's
difficult to um. Yeah. To create a profitable proposition for us which is
attractive for that type of customers it's very difficult, but we are
working on it, but I don't know whether it will succeed or not um so
yeah, those are actually the, yeah. The commodity proposition is not
very muchum. But for the EV targets we have a specific one. For the
solar we don't have a specific one. What we know is that a lot of solar
customers move to dynamic, which is, I think not very smart because in
the summer when you generate a lot of electricity you'll get negative.
actually you have to pay a fee for your for your electricity. But in the
market we see that, and that's because peoplewant to avoid the rela
cost yeah. Um, but maybe, uh, the, the fee they have to pay in some
reason may be higher depending on the, the number of solar panels.
Um, andwe have a dynamic price but not for solar panel, uh, customers,
only for. Customers without solar panels but from from December. We
also um offer that for this target group.
R Remco 45:28
If they still want it, yeah, yeah, yeah, and for the solar panels and EV, uh,
who are the customers that Fofa is is targeting because these are, of
course, growth, uh, areas and, uh, with acquisition targets, who are, who
are the customers currently being targeted, what, what defines them.
R Remco 45:50
Yeah, it's quite quite broad, um.
R Remco 45:55
We don't have a specific target group for now we should target this kind
of customer or this. It's the responsibility of the acquisition team who
they target. It's now it's quite broad. It's everyone actually in the
acquisition flow.
R Remco 46:19
Yeah. We have aum contract check tool, maybe you've seen it or not, or
maybe it's interesting to, to look at it. And it, it's, it's an uh. The tool it
aids people to make a choice ofwhat kind of contract is suitable for me
and it's, you are let through a couple of questions based on your
answers we give an advice, for example, in that case, a fixed fee, a fixed
fee contract suits you or a dynamic price contract suits you. Um And
that's away of
um connecting a a proposition to a specific target group,
I could say, yeah, yeah.
R Remco 47:07
We did campaigns on specific target groups, the electricity, electric
vehicle target group. We did a campaign on on them with the tight price
proposition. Um, it didn't convert very well, I guess. And it's a small dog
group now
because it's about a group who are charging their vehicles at
home. Yeah, and it's not avery large part of the Netherlands.
R Remco 47:35
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
R Raban 47:39
Um, One of the challenges, uh, I think that, that, uh, we recognize, but,
um, and see in the markets is of course the balance between the
sustainability and the and the affordability moving forward.
R Raban 47:53
Um, yeah, how do you see and moving forward in that in that balance,
um, uh, well, um, we, yeah, well these acquisition targets remain and the
growth, uh, focus remains. And also their, yeah, their security, of course
a threat becauseuh affordability becomes more and more important,
um. Yeah, what's your perspective on how, what direction photo should
take moving forward to to balance that the advantage is that we are
investing in sustainable energy.
R Remco 48:30
So we havewind um parks. So we can or actually we offer customers um
sustainable electricity. generated in the Netherlands, so for your
electricity, if you have that product, yeah, you're sustainable because it's
generated for 90% by windmills and 10% by solar panelsfor the gas, it's
different. The most ideal situation would be that we could offer green
gas.
R Remco 49:02
Guest produced from uh.
R Remco 49:09
trees and rotting trees and that kind of stu
ff, but there is not a lot of it,
so it's a scarce product. But the most ideal situation would be that we
could offer that to all our customers, green gas. So then also for your
gas consumption you're sustainable and you don't have to. Actually to
uh invest in your home because you have sustainable gas, but that's uh
challenge is that there is not enoughvolume to do that.
R Remco 49:45
Um, but as a fact of all, we can invest, uh, in, in production also for the
gas part.
R Remco 49:54
That's the advantage of above some other parties in the market. They
don't invest in generating electricity or gas on the production side. they
buy it somewhere in Europewith er certificates, so it's quite difficult for
customers to understandwhere their electricity is coming from.
R Remco 50:17
Uh, I think that's our competence, uh, advantage.
R Raban 50:21
Yeah, but I think the, the expectation is that that energy prices will keep
rising because of the energy transition and sustainable transition. Uh,
what is Fulton Falls, uh, yeah, strategy to make sure that that it also, uh,
stays, uh, that also will be affordable for people and also for customers
with memory, maybe lower and lower incomes, or is, isfor the fall
detracting maybe from that group and. Or focusing on high end
customers.
R Remco 50:50
No, no, yeah, you talk to Swan told you that we are focusing on the high
E target group and ITE target group are the peoplewho can afford it can
afford a pump andwho can afford electricvehicle. Um, so that, uh, I
think are the higher income groups, but, uh, as a fat, we, we represent,
uh, Yeah, the Netherlands because our base is built up from really
different types of customers and during the energy crisis we did a lot of
work to keep electricity and gas affordable also for the lower income
groups. We had a specific. Um, yeah, a sub sub sub sub subsidy, yeah,
um, so we did a lot of
uhwork on that.
R Remco 51:48
But in our acquisition.
R Remco 51:51
Um, yeah, in our exociation strategy we have Verlicht, maybe you've
heard of that, uh, that's uh the target group who areunder, um. Um, on
the Yeah I know what you mean yeah and and that's a specific
proposition for them but uh yeah lower prices.
R Remco 52:16
Um, but we bear a risk on them because they do those people, uh, they
have actually not enough money to, to pay that, uh, and, and they have,
uh, someonewho was looking at it. Um But the energy transition itself,
yeah, I don't think our strategy uh shall be that wewill invest in uhuh
make houses sustainable. To isolate houses or something like that, I
don't think that's our strategy. It's too expensive and one time just like
the solutions you mentioned, right? Yeah, yeah, we are not good in it and
it's not for us, not a positive business case because you're gaining only
a one off.
R Remco 53:02
Yeah, revenue. If there is a revenue, uh, we had also a time that on solar
panels therewas no revenue.
R Remco 53:10
It's not possible to create a recurring revenue stream from And an
energy transition, uh, solution.
R Remco 53:20
Therewere talks in the past about sort of loan construction, so you
could get a loan from and pay it back through your monthly bill, for
example, for sustained sustainability measures. But it's quite a different
thing and then as uh an energy company you have to be a finance
company also for you to, to need a partnership, so it's very difficult and
you have to activateuh thoseuh. Amounts on your balance, so that's
also very difficult, so there are a lot of
uh. Uh, yeah, boundaries, uh, why
that path is not, yeah, I think that that that's not the pathwe are
following from the strategy.
R Raban 54:10
It looks like the focus will be more on the high costs coming years, yeah,
but it's at the moment a small target group and I think in the next 10
years it will still be a small target group also dependent on the.
R Remco 54:26
Going through the economy, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I think it will
stay, stay a small group because I think in the strategy, uh, they say
basically that we'll swap around.
R Raban 54:37
It's now 6040, around 60traditional 40at least one solution, and they
expect that to switch around.
R Remco 54:44
Yeah, I think the high E, uh, yeah, with one solution, a solar panel is also
solution, uh, it's not, not, uh, in our, uh, advantage, I think. Um, but I'm
talking about looking at purely the high E dark group. Iwonder, it will
grow, but Iwonder if it will be a, a large group in, uh, 2030.
R Raban 55:07
Yeah, and, andwhen are you a high E customer?
R Remco 55:11
Uh, that's when you're, yeah, when your usage, usage is above a
certain, uh, yeah.
R Remco 55:21
Yeah, I think it's about more than 4000kilowatt hours.
R Raban 55:27
So I seewe're out of time and thanksfor reminding me. Uh, yeah, maybe
a final, final question, at least from my side. Um, so moving forward, the
next steps in the project, um, yeah, wewould really love to, uh, also have
your expertise and advice on thevalue side and. And later on when we
have more concrete opportunities, we also want to detail outfit more the
thevalue estimates and eventually also business case. um, so yeah, are
you
willing to support us there? I think also you have been discussing
this with Paul and Wilco, yeah, that's very, very, very good to hear.
R Raban 56:06
Um, and the other. No, no additionsfor me. I thinkwewill then organize
a meeting later with you to talk a bit more about the next steps and how
to collaboratewith you on that if that'sOK for you.
R Raban 56:20
Any other points. I thinkwe have a session also next week, or is it, but
therewas something planned on Wednesday, but it's my day off on
those two time slots I had a private appointment so I can't switch.
P4 Participant 4 56:37
I'll try to find another slot.
R Remco 56:39
It's good.
R Raban 56:41
Yeah, and is there avalue tree available, um, uh, like, uh, how, how the,
the, thevalue framework basically with the drivers now yeah yeah that
would be great, yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, andwe'll send an email with a
reminder I think yeah, that's good about that.
R Remco 57:02
Yeah, thank you so much.
G Giovanna 57:04
Thank you. You'rewelcome thank you yeah thank you yeah.

G Giovanna 0:00
Mhm. So I'm starting here and uh turning on co-pilot. So beforewewe
dive into this, just a quick introduction from my side and also from
Voucher's side. Uh, we both are part of Accenture Song, uh, which is the
creative agency powered by technology, part of Accenture, andwe do a
lot of
uh growth, hacking, growth, innovation and strategy. We do a lot of
um uh digital channels strategy. We do a lot of product creation. Uh,
everything that is under the scope of the from from a customer point of
view, so customer centricity, whether that's technology implementation
or creative assets, all of that, that's the type ofwork that we do. I come
from a strategic uh background, so my background is in service design,
as you can see, and uh probably already realized I'm not Dutch, um, I'm
uh I used to be part of Accenture Sao Paulo, so I'm Brazilian, Iwas based
in Sao Paulo back then. And I've been part of theuh Accenture Song
Dutch team for almost 3years now, so I've been in the Netherlands uh
for this uh for this period. And Walcher, do you
want to introduce
yourself?
W Wouter 1:08

Uh, I did a project for 3years ago, I think, on the engine project. Uh, so I
was involved, uh, from a marketing perspective of, OK, we are investing
a lot in technology, but how arewe going to get thevalue out of it? So
what kind of marketing activity shouldwe be doing? And now again back
at thoughts, good to be back. I already saw some familiar faces at the
office, but it's now a different challenge and I think a really nice
challenge.
G Giovanna 1:43
Which is now let me take over from you, which is exactly we have this
ambition wewant to contribute to, so wewant to collaboratewithuh
bringing new customers to the customer base in theupcoming two
years and the ambition that Fafo hasfrom an acquisition point ofview is
to bring 100to 1500new customers, um, and, uh, for that we. We are
tackling two different work streams, so we'reusing this different
approach, which is the first one focused on Horizon 2and 3, mostly,
which is establishing a sales growth strategy, uh, investigating in the
market, what are the opportunitiesfor us to create new growth avenues,
uh, what are new
big bets that uh Vattenfa needs to be investing on. Uh,
but also from a Horizon 1point ofview, that also tackles a bit of Horizon
2in some cases, but what are the, the improvements that we need to
promote and that we need to invest on when it comes to digital
channels. Um, and this is mostly what voucher isfocused on, um, to
help us becauseweunderstand that to achieve this super ambitious
target, we need a combination of these two work streams. So this is how
we're tackling this challenge. Uh, we'reworkinguh in avery integrated
way, uh, and this is also why
voucher is herewith me, um, today, so
we're gonna be. mixing, uh, very strategic high level questions but more
tactical as well in the day to day of implementation, creation definition of
new solutions andvalue propositions. So bear withus, we might ask
stupid questions, um, but, um, this is how we're going to be tackling
today and uh the goal is really to learn from you and from your
experiencewithinra and fold. So, um, then, uh, over to you. Uh, can you
explain, uh, for now, what is your role, what does your title comprise of?
What, what types of, uh, metrics do you pursue? What is your, what is
your team doing? Can you giveus a bit of context about yourself, your
experiencewithin Bainfo and your team?
N Noortje 3:54
Yeah, yeah, I can, uh, I'm responsible for product management, um, so
this, uh, includes, um, yeah, the responsibility of thewhole commercial
portfolio, uh, we offer to our consumer and small businesses, um, under
the BTC, um, scope, then Iwould assume right because individuals
within BTC. So small businesses arewithin the BTC segment and the
portfolio consists of commodity, so electricity, gas contracts wherewe
are mainly responsible for the development of the portfolio. So we are
not responsible for pricing, sourcing. Um, putting it into systems, uh, so
not that part of management, but we are responsible for, uh, adding, um,
to look at new opportunities, um, so adding new contracts, new, um, uh,
ways to, yeah, to, to. Yeah, to, to, to match customer expectation on new
market developments. So we added it um dynamic price, we added, we
added a time of
use propositions, andwe added um uh home energy
management. Solutions, so that that's the the the and sorry, and not to
forget green gas or biomethane contract, um, that's commodity part and
then uhwe also offer a solution portfolio. Um, that is, uh, charging
solutions uh for a home charging and for business charging for the small
businesses, um.
N Noortje 6:01
Uh, charging stations, but also chargingum uh subscription, andwe are
also looking at charging, uh, um, um, uh, in, in, yeah, charging buses. So
when you're not at home.
G Giovanna 6:22
So that so that you can use other chargers in the street exactly, yeah,
yeah, yeah, mainly when you'reum when you're on your way, and then,
uh, also, uh, heat pump solutions, um, we have our own, own, uh, um,
yeah, high temperature heat pump.
N Noortje 6:43
This is a fossil f
uel product.
G Giovanna 6:46
Yeah, this is a hardware, right?
N Noortje 6:48
Sorry, it's a hardware, right. Yeah, it's, yeah, it's a system, it's hardware,
uh, a system comprising of, of different, um, uh, yeah, different, different
uh parts by, uh, different, uh, manu
facturers. So, but uh. We, we made it
into one system, um, for the, for the existing buildings.
N Noortje 7:17
Uh, this is soldvia Fetra, our own, uh, installment party. And, uh, and
other heat pump systems we install viauh Feinstra or other partners.
Um, but we have a proposition andwe are also looking at adding
services to these heat pump customers to both acquire and retain them
in our base.
N Noortje 7:50
Uh, we offer also uh solar systems and solar solutions, uh, andwe offer
um uh sustainability advice, personal sustainability advice, uh, online.
Uh, this is toolinguhvia the app or theMyhool um um. Um, uh, website,
thank you. And, uh, last but not least, we are also looking into a new
loyalty program. Uh, and oncewe launch that, uh, the, uh, the
management will be taken over by a customer, uh, experience
management. OK, so we bring in, yeah, the innovation there.
G Giovanna 8:44
So, um, to make it clear, what you and your team do is, um, you develop.
G Giovanna 8:53
These solutions, so products and services that are connected to the
core objectives of Attenfo, um, to offer to your clients and to more
specifically to B2C, which means, um, individuals and also
entrepreneurs, yeah, right, and maybe added to that is we both manage
and develop. OK, you both, so you own the products.
N Noortje 9:24
Yeah, OK, OK, brilliant. We are the product owners, brilliant.
G Giovanna 9:29
OK, um, and, uh, then already an immediate follow-up question on this.
Who are the key areas that you need to collaboratewith to make sure
that these solutions are brought to market?
G Giovanna 9:45
Or that they are developed. What are the key other departmentsfor to
go to market.
N Noortje 9:51
Well, yeah, we go to market, we, uh, wework together with, uh, with
MCO, so the, the marketing departments, um, where is, uh, is part of,
um, they are responsible for the positioning, uh, for thewhole go to
market plan of all our solutions. OK. And all our commodity contracts,
yeah, and for the development, we, we rely on agile teams and these
agile teams arewithin different departments. So there are agile teams
within the department DTI, SE, and MCO.
G Giovanna 10:38
OK, yeah, can you, can you, uh, point out the leads of these, these, uh,
these teams. So we're talking about Fleur, right? Yeah, Fleur is, uh,
responsible for DDII and agile teams we areworkingwe areworkingwith
closely in her department are, uh, the clover team responsible for the
sustainability advice.
N Noortje 11:02
Uh, also, uh, the immobility HLT responsible of course for the immobility
solutions, um, within the team of Helene Boer, so Sam, we arewe are
reliant, yeah, reliant on the agile teams of, um, uh, the loyalty, that's the
loyalty team of
Rohi Tillema.
N Noortje 11:29
Uh, he is building the new loyalty program. Uh, we are relying on sales
how, so, so retaining our customers, um, for, yeah, several, so he's
responsible for the prolongation of, uh, uh, for the retaining offer. Um,
we are also relying on Omega, which is uh the agile team responsible for
insight and usage, insight in the, in the, in the electricity and gas usage.
N Noortje 12:08
Uh, we are relying on the teams within the Department of Yolanda,
marketing for all the sales, uh, the salesflows. So we have a solar check.
We have a heat pump checkwhich our salesflowsfor added orientation
and leads to uh for solar systems and heat pumps. OK.
N Noortje 12:39
Um Um, what do I miss?
G Giovanna 12:43
So I thinkuh maybeuh looking at uh from a more from a broader
perspective, we're also trying to understandwhat are the gaps, what are
the main challenges and pain points in that collaboration becauseum we
have identified already a few gaps in processes, how things are built,
how things are distributed. Can you talk a bit more about what are the
main challenges that you
facewhen it comes to to collaboratingwith
thesewith these teams and um Getting traction, gaining traction on the
solutions that you create.
N Noortje 13:16
Yeah, looking at the commodity portfolio, uh, what I just told you is that
we launched two new contract types, um, dynamic pricing and time of
use pricing. Uh, so, uh, our commercial names are Flex Press and Ted
Press. Uh, we looked, of course, at markets and opportunities andwe
saw, we seewe see large opportunitiesfor these for these new contract
forms. We see a lot of churn towards um energy providers offering
dynamic contracts.
G Giovanna 13:57
Can you, can you point out which one specifically, which other
competitors and the day.
N Noortje 14:04
Uh, and also, uh, Frank Energy, OK. Um, We, we launched our dynamic
contract in February of this year and uhwe still, yeah, we have, we still
see a large churn towards other parties, so we do not retain the
customers yet with our uh dynamic price offering and so what I see is
that um. Yeah, this is, this was, this was also conscious, but, but, but,
yeah, you asked mewhat, what is the challenge here, so We do not offer
flex in our channels, so we do not reach our customers. Customers who
are interested in this contract type do not know. We offer dynamic
pricing to new customers or the existing ones. New, both new and
existing customers.
N Noortje 15:16
Becausewe, yeah, we do not promote the products. Uh, it is not in our,
in all of our channels, um, uh, and, uh, wherewe promote it, um, it is
very modest. So we do not. Um, explain the advantages in theway that
they or Frank Energy does.
W Wouter 15:43
Why do you think that is?
N Noortje 15:45
Becauseum there is a difference in margin between our fixed price
contract and our dynamic price contract. And uh there is uh yeah.
N Noortje 16:02
fear that we're going to lose margin when too many customers choose
for dynamic pricing.
N Noortje 16:12
So it's it's avery, it's a risk aversing strategy.
W Wouter 16:20
Is there a business case that proves otherwise?
N Noortje 16:23
Yeah, of coursewe see a lot of customers leaving, so there's your case.
So that's also the reason why wewant to change this now, so a different
marketing approach.
N Noortje 16:34
Clear. And yeah, and also the focus of
uh marketing is on volumes, and
so uh large quantity, large type of groups of customers. And um. Uh, so,
and, and, and, and, and, yeah, they think then that Flex isfor too small a
group or her time of
use isfor too small a group. And they choose every
time for fixed price.
N Noortje 17:12
So they choose all the time, so all the promotions are on fixed price. OK,
so there is, there is, there is not enough attention in my perspective for
the new contract types and the new opportunities.
G Giovanna 17:24
So can I, can we, can I, can I assume that uhwe are talking about a few
challenges in this collaboration. When it comes to aligning on how you
are measured. Or what is value, becausewhen I, when you, when you
say, uh, we see a big opportunity in the market becausewe see a high
churn towards other competitors because they offer this andwe don't
offer and then we comeup with the solution wewant to bring to market
and then marketing says, but our focus is not on reducing chur and our
focus is on bringing new customers, arewe talking about two different
KPIs that are contradictory?
N Noortje 18:03
No, no, no, no, no, no, that's not, uh, may, uh, not as what you how you
summarized it, so they, of course, have a churn, uh, and that they have a
focus on reducing churn, so that is an important KPI.
N Noortje 18:21
Uh, so that's not the issue, but they, um, they look on on bigger
volumes. Yeah, so there's a marketing and there's a marketing team
focusing on acquisition, and then acquisition team focuses more on the
highvolumes and the fixed price contracts.
W Wouter 18:40
The dynamic contract markets, although doubled over the last year, is
still relatively small, right, but increasing, yeah.
N Noortje 18:50
OK, so they, yeah, they, they are mostly looking at bigger fishes and, uh,
and they are, yeah, in my perspective, we should do more segment
segmented, uh, marketing, brilliant, brilliant, uh, that leads me to my
next question.
G Giovanna 19:08
voucher, can you maybe drag to the to the to the segments.
G Giovanna 19:13
Even one more, one more, one more or more. Sorry again, here, yeah.
So, um, we realizedwe have this segment, well, so we received this, uh,
this slide, it has been explained to us, uh, for avery long time already.
We're kind of like breaking it down and trying to understand eachuh
small topic. We lost your screen somehow. Oh, there you go, um. And
there are these 8, strategic segments, uh, as, as they're called, right,
um. What is your take on on on this type of segmentation? And uh
becausewe saw two different types, so we saw this one andwe saw the
the more behavioral type of segmentation when it talks about control,
openness, sustainability solutions. So how, what is your vision on this
segmentation that we have and how do these correlate, um, in your
point ofview?
N Noortje20:16
Um, yeah, this, this. Um.
N Noortje20:25
What we see is that uh the the segments uhwithuhwith solutions is
growing but are still niches and uhwe see a challengewith the heat
pump segments.
N Noortje20:44
So, uh, uh, so, so the heat pump segment is defined as one of our
strategic. Um, uh, segments, uh, customer groups, but The heat pump
um uh customer has a lower NPV, a lower um value.
N Noortje21:10
than our average customer. Becauseum we're losinguh gas, and most
of these customers have solar panels, so we have back delivery, uh, and
so thevalue of this group is lower, and this is contradictory to the
marketingKPIs because marketing is looking at both thevolumewhat I
just mentioned, so we haveuh base targets with Acquisition and
retention contributing, but we also, they also, andwe, I also share this
this this target. We also have an NPV target, avalue target.
N Noortje21:57
And so the the segmentsfor heat pump as well as EV do not have
volume, but the segment, especially for heat pumps, does not haveMPV
either. So this is a big challenge. So these segments are mainly for
another KPI, CO2reduction.
N Noortje22:22
The heat pump segments we have had difficulty with theMPV and
volume targets, or the epit targets.
W Wouter 22:32
Andwhose responsibility is it to make a business model for such
solutions? Is that the caveo team or is that your team?
N Noortje22:45
Um, I don't maybe, yeah, to, to, to make sure that I understand your
question, can you put it in another way?
W Wouter 22:55
So, so indeed the conclusion is that OK, there's a new, there's a
challenge on heat pumps to make it profitable.
W Wouter 23:05
Whose responsibility is it to make it profitable and to maybe look into
yeah, other ways of monetizing this um service or whatsoever, how to
turn this into a profitable product.
N Noortje23:19
Yeah, I think this is a shared challenge. So, um, we as a product, uh,
management development have to look at new
business models.
N Noortje23:36
Uh, and also, uh, Cao, um, is, yeah, is also looking at uh margins and, uh,
value of
uh electricity contracts.
N Noortje23:51
So we can look at new services, add to to new
business models to make
up for a loss in gas. And maybe also to makeup for loss in electricity
when customers are having solar panels, but Cario is responsible for the
ads because, yeah, we, we, I hopewe retain the customer on electricity
and how to makeup in electricity for the loss in gas.
G Giovanna24:31
So, uh, so, so the shredded because, um.
G Giovanna24:35
Just uh, just to also also clarify my understanding so far of all the
interviews that we have, right, so. Uh, Val's core business is under
commodity, is under, uh, sourcing, distributing energy and gas, right?
This is under a lot of pressure, so a lot of margins, uh, the competitors
are, are competing for price here, uh, the customers are shifting a lot
because prices have increased, so therefore you have a lot of, a lot of
shifting from one competitor to the other, right? Um, But still is the main
source of
uh profitability uh for for Vattenfa, but we see a big shift in the
market. So what you're saying is, whenever um whenever we see
customers, for instance, with, with avery low or unexistent guest, um,
guess consumption, then The strategy overall is to compensatewith
energy by bringing solutions that increase their energy consumption.
Uh, while gas is reducing.
N Noortje25:45
Well, yeah, and, and. Because you can also look at um at uh services in
the commodity portfolio. So for, for instance, the Uh, The the the the the
home home energy management solutions, you can also ask for
subscription fee there, of course.
N Noortje26:11
And so this can beuh new ways of
bringing in the new revenue, yeah,
uh, but then shifting shifting from commodity to service, right, to added
value and uh other business model that is not.
G Giovanna26:28
Yeah, there, yeah, OK, yeah, yeah, because you mentioned solutions.
N Noortje26:33
What we, what we mean with solutions is mostly theum the energy
saving solutions, so more hardware like solar systems, charging stations,
etc. etc. yeah, but when we talk about he, we're really talking about
services.
G Giovanna26:51
Yeah, OK, yeah, clear. Uh, OK, so thanks, voucher for moving to this
slide. I think this is an important one. Can you, um, I think, I think you
already mentioned quite a few solutions and, uh, uh, new products in the
backlog that are moving towards and and and that are helping but and
fall shift in terms of positioning, right, when it comes to strategy. Can
you uh elaborate a bit on this take here andwhat are the main
challenges that uh that Vattenfa is uh facing in switching gears in terms
of strategy?
N Noortje27:27
Yeah. Yeah, so we see opportunities in the in the hemps corner, and this
can bring new revenues, but we are still Uh, yeah, looking at um how we
can build this platform, how we can um enter these markets. So this is
in, in, in, in an early stage, uh, and, um, so it's, yeah. I think there are
opportunities, but we Yeah, we are not yet there to Uh, to confirm this
and to, to, yeah, to really Um, make money in this segments. So we
startedwithum smart charging. This is a small segment, of course.
N Noortje28:27
Um, we see a lot of, a lot of attraction, so a lot of customers want this
service, but we don't ask money for it yet. OK.
N Noortje28:40
Um, and other opportunities arewithin, yeah, smart heating or smart
storage, but these are still at this moment, uh, smaller segments.
W Wouter 28:56
Why is that?
N Noortje28:58
Because of the limited amount of electric cars and charging stations at
home and because of the limited amount of heat pumps at home. And
batteries, of course, for smart storage because there's the25% of the
market has solar panels, right, and is afraid of the saving.
W Wouter 29:25
So they're probably looking to a solution to store their um so will the,
yeah, is that an opportunity either via the Flex offering or via local
storage to solve that, or?
N Noortje29:40
Yeah, yeah, you can see an opportunity there. So we see a lot ofwe have
a lot of customers with solar panels. So that's a large group you're
you're correct there.
N Noortje29:51
But uh. For storage. Uh there you see at smaller segments. So not
everyone has the opportunity to charge at home or not that everybody
wants to invest in a battery.
N Noortje 30:08
Or heat pump, so we need to convince them on these larger
investments.
W Wouter 30:15
You think that that needwill increasewhen the yeah, yeah, then you see
better business casesfor our customers to invest in boilers or bombs or
with bu
ffer or boiler or the standalone battery. Andwhat will you then
offer becauseum yeah, selling a battery or a boiler is a one-off. So what
servicewill you then provide to to monetize that?
N Noortje 30:50
Yeah, we can both look at the hem surfaces. So, um, so, uh, and next to
smart charging also offers smart heating, smart storage services on
more hem surfaces. Andwe can also offer bundles.
W Wouter 31:10
OK.
N Noortje 31:11
Yeah. And, um, and also a maintenance.
W Wouter 31:19
And is that something likely to happen because of course, our target is
within 2years offering such solutions, is that something that could be
donewithin the next 2years or, or do you expect to happen?
N Noortje 31:36
Yeah, I expect that wewill offer new he services within 2years next to
the smart charging. Yeah, Iwould bevery disappointed ifwe could not.
Reach that ambition. Sounds good.
G Giovanna 31:52
Any, any other questions? Yeah, uh, in regards to this shift in strategy
into moving closer to hands, uh, what are the, the main challenges that
we that we foresee and also, um, Um, again, in regards to challenges,
maybe, um, steering this a bit, what are the capabilities that we're still
lackingwithin Wainfo to to realize this shift towards um him.
N Noortje 32:28
Um, yeah, so we just talked about a shift to the right, but we did not talk
about the shift, uh, uh, vertically, and that is A more segmented
personalized offer. So that's that's what we lack right now
becausewe
do have a larger portfolio than fixed price andvariable price, but we We
do not Offer it broadly. Andwe do not know what customers to uh to
target withwhat type of products.
N Noortje 33:14
So, everything, um, yeah, it is.
N Noortje 33:20
It it is Well, it, it is still the same product as 10years ago, the fixed price
product with the cashback. So how can we look at it would be great if
weLooked at theusage of the customer, the needs of the customer.
Does hewant flexibility or does hewant certainty in price, and the
solutions within his home or business, and then offer the product within
our portfolio which matches the best and to explain why that is because
everyone gets the same. And offer at this moment a fixed price.
W Wouter 34:09
Andwhy is not succeeding in doing that well.
N Noortje 34:15
Um, we do not recognize, uh, the customer with, uh, some solutions, so
we, it's hard to recognize the customer with the heat pump. We can
improve this.
N Noortje 34:31
Marketing is not yet segment, uh, yeah, it's not, um.
N Noortje 34:40
How do you, uh, yeah, they, they do not look at different segments,
consumer and, and, and small businesses, but within that, they don't
have segment-based marketing. Mhm.
W Wouter 34:54
And is it due to technical reasons or?
N Noortje 34:58
Uh, both, yeah, yeah, you can, yeah, technical, you can manage, of
course, if you
want. So it's, it's, it's, um.
N Noortje 35:08
It's looking at volumes at this moment, yeah.
G Giovanna 35:16
Clear.
N Noortje 35:18
Um, and, um.
N Noortje 35:22
So, and also I can and, and looking at my own department, we can, we
can offer uh different groups of customers more services. Mhm.
N Noortje 35:35
So, the last couple of years, the focus of my department was on
solutions, so that had the the solar panels, uh, heat pump, etc. but now
we need to focus more on the subscriptions and services with the, with
the recurring revenue.
G Giovanna 35:55
Mhm. Because, becauseweunderstood that uh this, this uh 11how to
say this one time. Uh, one-off type of, uh, revenue is not sustainable and
that we need to manage growth throughout time. OK, yeah, yeah, so our
focus needs to be onM
RR, yeah, yeah, yeah, and, um.
G Giovanna 36:21
What was my next question?
G Giovanna 36:24
So uhwe talked about the the the challengevertically, right, in terms of
segmentation, lack of this lack of capability, whether that's technical or
or not, right, uh, and not being able to segment and to target in in in uh
in customers specific segments to, to provide and to offer solutions.
What about, uh, what else about moving to the right? What are, what are
other challenges becausewe talked about the the the one time revenue,
then we talked about uh moving towards a more service driven and
recurringum revenue model, um. Based on service, not so much in
commodity becausewe see a lot of pressure there in terms of margins,
but what are the things in terms of capabilities and other challenges that
Vattenfall isfacing right now to be moving more to the right?
G Giovanna 37:27
What else, what is lacking?
N Noortje 37:33
Well, in the end, it comes down to um decreasing the energy uh price for
our customers. Andwhen we can prove this, um, yeah, we can, we can
reach the customer, of course.
G Giovanna 37:51
Andwhy, why do you say decreasing the, the, the price? I know this
might sound an ob
vious ob
vious question, but can you explain why is
this a key?
N Noortje 38:03
Well, the, yeah, the, the. The biggest criteria for customers to choose for
an energy supplier is price still.
N Noortje 38:16
And um, Uh, prices increased, um, uh, over, over the, so it's coming their
focus even, even more. There are lots of, of new opportunities to um add
to, to efficiently use your energy and uh and also save on, on, on energy
consumption. So what can we do as an energy provider to Help you uh
use less or use it more efficient to decrease prices uh in sourcing or in
other ways, and help customers make the energy bill more payable.
That, that is what I thinkwhat customers ask from us.
G Giovanna 39:16
And uhwhen it comes to, I thinkwe heard a lot of trends and uh even
shifting trends because I thinkwe expected this to develop much more
when it comes to trading, like peer trading of energy, do you think this is
an opportunity area for Wattenthal to tap into?
N Noortje 39:39
I think that will be more something for power peers.
N Noortje 39:44
I think that is spot on for Power peers. Shouldwe, shouldwe retain the
the brand Power Piers, Iwould.
N Noortje 39:54
Use that as a kind of of of propositionsfor that brand, yeah, OK, clear.
G Giovanna 40:02
OK you gonna ask something, yeah, because you mentioned, OK, we
need to have a specific offering that will help them save money through
more sustainable products.
W Wouter 40:12
What kind of sustainable product would that be then? Would that be?
W Wouter 40:16
Yeah, that's the question actually.
N Noortje 40:21
Uh, yeah, so, um, uh, what I just, so what is the right product for them,
uh, looking at their current usage and their current situation? What are
opportunities to shift?
N Noortje 40:37
Without too much comfort loss, of course, because and towards lower
price hours and then advise them that kind of products. So what is, what
is the product based on their current usage? What can they do to make
it even. Uh, uh, better to shift usage, and how can and advices we bring
on, um, uh, adding new solutions to their home to even Uh, save more,
so, uh, a heat pump or, or a boiler or or or a remote stand-alone battery.
N Noortje 41:30
For solar customers, of course, how can you makeuse of your own Solar
energy and also within the maintenance department, how can we make a
combination of
both an energy contract and a maintenance contract so
like Vodafone Ziggo do or budgetgy withwith the internet and and
television. Um, we are looking at ways to also make an offer of
uh energy
and maintenance becausewe know that maintenance is away, um, had
to, uh, to improve the, uh, yeah, the, the, your heating system, bothuh
uh heat pump as well as uh CV.
G Giovanna 42:27
And also kind of spreading this cost, right, and uh reducing it, the long
term cost for, for the, for the customers. Yeah, so it's, it's.
N Noortje 42:37
Yeah, it's it's the more sustainableway to handle your system, your
heating system. You can also offer it for solar, and uh so solar monitoring
or solar maintenance.
N Noortje 42:51
To, uh, yeah, to make sure your system is, is, is, is, is most efficient,
works at, at its best and is well maintained, uh, and then, um, um, yeah,
we also have this loyalty hook, of course.
N Noortje 43:12
Because if customers leave and fall or uh yeah, then they will lose their
uh their discount on maintenance contracts. Andwe know that
maintenance contract is something customers want. But they have
difficulty finding it um um in the installment branch, and also it's quite
expensive, especially for if you have for, for, for heat pump customers,
you have both your um your CV and you have your new heat pump.
N Noortje 43:50
The costs are already, I think, more than€15a month.
W Wouter 43:56
The solutions are then more affordable than the older solutionsfor the
customers.
N Noortje 44:03
Yeah, we, yeah, um, ifweum This is a business case based on churn
reduction, of course. So ifwe give Um, a discount and the partner we
areworkingwith is given a discount, uh, then you can. Offer an
attractiveuh total package.
G Giovanna 44:30
So, so there is a big bat into those bundles, right, into those packages,
services together with hardware, so it's, it's this combination. This is a
as an expected growth as a solution being provided. OK, nice, uh,
voucher, can we go to the circular, um, slide. Uh, we know that, uh, there
is, so we also, we are aware of this slide, and I thinkwewould like to
understand ifwe already have aview on what are the solutions that are
plugged per per per strategic segment, what are the energy services,
how arewe segmenting this, what is the marketing approach? Well,
marketing approach more from the marketing, but what are the things
that are plugged in there arevery specific. Uh, to each one of this, the
strategic customer segments andwhat is the development in this area?
Do you have any f
urther information about this? Do we have double
clicks and deep dives on each one of the The the segments.
N Noortje 45:34
Um, yeah, here you see the, thewhole chain in fact. So here you see the,
the connection of all the different domains. So now, um, uh, uh, what we
do is, is, is, is, is very. Moreworking in islands or we are, so we are
looking at ENG all departments are looking at ENG and selling it, and
another department is, is, is, is selling solutions and so we, we need to
make it more one offer or to, to look at ways to enhance. Uh, the
different offerings. So, uh, let me give an example. um.
N Noortje 46:24
What we are trying to do now is, uh, for instance, I think that's that's the
best example becausewe have the broad portfolio for this segment, the
EV segments, with thewith the home charging station. So we have a
specific commodity contract, so a specific products.
N Noortje 46:52
Uh, this is called, um, uh, Tara. OK, so you have this, had this, um, uh,
opportunity to charge your car at the lowest hours during the night, um,
then, uh, we also have, uh, the, uh, the, the smart charginguh solution.
Uh, so this energy, uh, services andwithin the loyalty program, so we
offer a new loyalty program, you get um um uh points every year, and
these represent a certain value, and for this value for these points, you
can get a discount on your, um, yeah, your contracts or your solutions.
Um, so for the, for the, for the EV segments, you can, you can say, OK,
you haveuhuhuh an electric car and the charging stations, we can offer
uh the charging subscription for free if you use your loyalty points. So
wewill put this into the spotlight.
N Noortje 48:10
And that the specific. Subscription can be free. Use your points and And
then, um, also, um uhuh Yeah, within the app, the app, wewill make
surewe show the customer what hewill save on energy when he
charges his car during the night with these specific contracts andwhat
he also can earn because the smart charging is is is is an earning part.
What you can earn when you charge your car during the night but at
specific points within these these nights.
N Noortje 49:02
So we make surewe show them in the app what he can earn, what he
can save.
N Noortje 49:10
So this is all connected. I don't know if I make myselfvery clear, but we
need to make a more a circle and to make sure that. We recognize the
customer as a customer with a charging station. We offer him the
specific energy contract, which is the best for this type of customer
looking at his consumption and his solution. We make surewe offer the
extra services in the form of smart charging. We make sure in the app,
so the customer experience to make sure. What heuses andwhat he
saves andwhat he earns, so what he yeah, and also of course then what
the advantages are of oxen becausewe help him save andwe help him
earn andwith the loyalty program.
N Noortje 50:05
You can, you can add your, your budget, your loyalty budget specifically
for the services you need.
G Giovanna 50:13
Yeah, no, it is, it is pretty, pretty clear now. No, thanksfor explaining.
Um, my follow
up question isfor each one of the strategic, uh, customer
segments, so let's let's give the, the example of the traditional ENG
without any sustainable solutions. Havewe already have, havewe
already got this view on that specific segment? Do we already know
exactly what are the energy services that we need to provide? What is,
what is the tone ofvoice that we should beusing? What is, do we
already have that, uh, double click?
N Noortje 50:53
Well, this is a this is avery large segment, there are different, different,
different needs, but We, we have information about becausewithin this
segment you have customers who are not able to because they hire their
house and they are not able to to make their home more sustainable.
N Noortje 51:22
But what can you do andwhat can you do? What is the best, what is the
best contract we have for you? How can you save money?
N Noortje 51:32
Andwhat are servicesfor you. Uh, for customers who do haveum ways
to make the home more sustainable andwant to, we can offer, of course,
different types of solutions and also use the loyalty budgets.
N Noortje 51:50
To, um, yeah, to, to, to giveuh a discount and to make it easier for them.
To make these steps and also advise them as what is what is the best
step you can make, and this is the budget you get from us to take that
step.
G Giovanna 52:10
Yeah, but do we have this correlation? Do we have a double click on
each one of the segments to understand these are other, these are the
behaviors that you can findwithin this segment, we don't, right?
N Noortje 52:21
No, not, not, not, uh, no.
G Giovanna 52:25
And uh my one last question becausewe only have 4minutes to go, uh,
actually my
voucher if you
wanna add anything, feel free to. But um I'm
very curious in the process that uh the CSD is that correct?
G Giovanna 52:45
Uh, the, yeah, exactly, um, I'm, I'm really curious in how you develop the
propositions. I'm curious to understandwhere is this innovation or where
is this. The solution creation coming from? What are the triggers? Is it a
market assessment? Does it come from customers? Uh, does it come
from avision from someone internally that says this is maybe this is the,
what is it the, where does it come from? Where do the initiatives and
solutions come from?
N Noortje 53:14
Well, all of the above, what you just mentioned, but, uh, our starting
point is our strategy. OK, so it'sfrom aviability point ofview, right?
G Giovanna 53:24
What brings more margin, what brings growth to VAT and fall, so it
comesfrom an internal assessment.
N Noortje 53:31
Well, we have, we have a strategy, long term KPIs, short term KPIs, and
what do we need to meet both short and long term KPIs. So what is
missing in a certain domain? That is, that is, that is our starting point,
mostly for developing our our portfolio. And then, uh, and, and also we
look at market opportunities.
G Giovanna 54:01
So what are other, other competitors offering that we're not, yeah, or
opportunities like, uh, what, what happens on the because because of
the, thevolatility in the in the electricity pricing that's uh that we now
see a big market for um uh dynamic pricing.
N Noortje 54:22
That's a market developments, uh, and, um, and, and, yeah, we are. A
smart follower. So first we look at, um, andwe of coursewe look at the
market andwe see these different developments and then we look, OK,
how
big is it going to be if it's going to be, if it's small, we then we look
at how it develops and then we see for instance the dynamic price here
we see it's getting bigger and bigger and then we step in.
G Giovanna 54:53
Yeah, yeah, um, and, uh, and then, so this isfor the origination of the
solutions when it comes to prioritize, apologies, prioritizing the
solutions, what is it the main criteria? Is it volume, is it how much margin
or how much profitability that's that's gonna bring? What is awhat it
what is it that help you say we're going for this solution instead of that,
likewe're pushing this one instead of this one.
N Noortje 55:21
Um, mostly a contribution, OK, yeah, yeah, but we also have, uh, we also
have solutionsfor the CO2reduction, uh, KPI, which is, which is, is this a
strategic KPI or is this aKPIs? Yeah, so for instance, we still offer solar
panels. This is not a big contributor at this right now, yeah, but, yeah, we
heard this in every interview.
G Giovanna 55:52
Yeah, yeah, is really concernedwith this, yeah, yeah, but this is more
proof of purpose and and uh and a CO2reduction, but yeah, no, it's uh.
Yeah, that's not gonna make a bottom and grow, um, in the short term,
unfortunately. OK, I have to go. My, my next meeting already popped in
here.
N Noortje 56:14
I just if I helped you. I should there be any questions, please ask. Thank
you
for, for sure.
G Giovanna 56:20
It was very helpf
ul. And uh maybe 11last piece of advice from your side
in order for us to now that you know the scope, now that you know a bit
ofwhat we're doing. Is there any piece of advice on how we can be
successf
ul? Like, what are things that we need to take into consideration
to make sure that we're doing a good job and that we are creating real
impact for Val?
N Noortje 56:42
Well, I think I, I mentioned most, but what I did not mention yet is look at
our positioning, look at uhwhat uhuh our competitors are doing at this
moment, and look at how arewe communicating. Becausewe are
communicating quite Yeah, thank you.
G Giovanna 57:05
That's a great expression. I didn't know this. I think Iwas gonna say
bluntly, but you said pizza margarita, that's clear.
G Giovanna 57:14
Uh, yeah, makes sense.
N Noortje 57:16
good analogy, yeah.
G Giovanna 57:18
OK, brilliant, uh, thank you so much. It was very insightf
ul, very helpf
ul.
Thank you and uh you
will uh be involved in next steps. Uh, we're gonna
make sure to put you in the loop.
N Noortje 57:31
OK, thank you. Good luck.
G Giovanna 57:32
Thank you. Bye bye



**Fleur (Digital Strategy)**


G Giovanna 0:01
OK, amazing, so, uh, let's start by, um. A bit of explanation actually of
what we're doing, uh, we have, um, read through, uh, most of the
documents that were shared and then we have some specific questions,
but also some some high level strategic questionsfrom from our side,
but it's really for us to capture your vision um of Attenfo, uh, your
experience, your perspective, and, um, yeah, to, to gain a bit of
understanding ofwhere should um. Should the company be heading,
what are the insights, what are ambitions and so on, I thinkwewe have
covered a bit during kickoff, but then we're going to be deep diving on
um specific segments.
G Giovanna 0:46
So just to start, can you briefly start by introducing yourself, talking
about your role, uh, and your focus, uh, which type of KPIs, what, what
does value mean for you and for your team?
F Fleur 0:59
Uh, yes, I can imagine that for you, it's, it's also a bit learning how the
what is the mandate of each director andwhat is the scope, etc. So for
me, uh, as director of digital and data innovation, uh, my scope is really
about innovation and IT steering. So I'm responsible for steering the IT
demand towards Vodaf for IT, uh, all the budgets, the sizing of the
teams. Um, on a yearly business plan perspective, I have a look at how
much budget do we have, what do we allocate to big projects, which big
Share Editable
Fleur (Digital Strategy) G
Browse Upgrade
Search or ask anything G
projects arewe doing? What kind of agile teams do we have? What
should the sizing be of these agile teams, andwhat new agile teams are
we adding? For example, this year we added a touch point excellence
team for the Vauxhall Energy app. Becauseuhwe have 7different teams
working on features in the app, but nobody is working on the
omnichannel features. So, for example, the navigation, uh, this is, this is
one of the examples, uh, you know, that that we're doing.
F Fleur 2:08
Um, also, another important part of how we do digital within Bottlefall is
that we kind of have a democratized IT. So I have a few of the digital
channels.
F Fleur 2:20
Helene Boer as customer experience director, she has a A few digital
channels and Yolanda Baker, as marketing and sales director also has a
few digital channels. Uh, and of course, Bernard Steinberg as director,
customer service also has a few channels, but those are mainly the the
the demanded channels. So the the channels that I own are the app and
the chatbots.
F Fleur 2:48
That is my scope. Andwhat is very interesting is that we kind of have an
equilibrium within the company on a political, uh, on a strategic and
tactical level because, becausewe have this ownership which is kind of
spread across the company. So what I see is that Yolanda comes to me
and the expertise of my team with respects to her channels. So at the
growth strategy project that she's running right now, uh, you know,
some of my architects are involved. I also have privacy and security, so
these are, and also I do the tactical portfolio uh steering of the projects,
so that's why she comes to me for those things and same thing for
Elaine.
F Fleur 3:34
So I'm kind of involved in everything, so my scope is really broad.and
what what what I add is really the expertise on from a digital
perspective. So everything from consultancy to architecture to data to
UX experienceuh to uh yeah, all the different fields of expertisewith
that respect. So if you look at the sales targets, the sales targets are
really Yolanda.
F Fleur 4:05
So I don't have, um, I don't have acquisition targets myself.
F Fleur 4:12
Uh, what I do share, for example, is a churn target because I'm doing the
engine project, and the engine project has the goal of doing more
personalized sales.
F Fleur 4:25
Um, So I let me, I could also grab my scorecard so to show you a little
bit. So, um, so yeah, um I think that's that's, that's an important target
that I have, but I don't have any acquisition numbers.
F Fleur 4:43
But you know, from a holistic perspective, even though I don't have the
acquisition targets myself, I, you know, I try and help everybody, all the
agile teams, to understand that the prioritiesfor their backlogs are really
for the acquisition to to to be turned on. So for example, I have also I
haveuh maybe 6agile teams, so I have the app and the chatbot, but I
also haveuh theuh do some heights of fees, um, how you say that.
F Fleur 5:19
The cart as we call it in Dutch.
F Fleur 5:21
Uh, which is the advice on sustainability advice.
F Fleur 5:27
And the sustainability advice, what Tim Clover is doing, um, Leon Vander
Bays is the product owner. He has awealth of information. Uh, he sits on
a database ofwhat our customers have in terms of house. So in terms of
the already the customers that we have, we can then serve out next best
actions and next best offers that are personalized to their situation
because he sits on a databasewherewe know what kind of house, we
know what kind of products they have, etc. So that's something also
that is in my team. Andwhat I think is very interesting is what his team is
doing to kind of turn this on and use it in the in the lead f
unnel and in the
acquisition. So what I did toLeon is that I told him, OK, I saw that um
prospects is was at the lowest part of his priorities in terms of
backlog.
So I told him, Leon, I think you should move that up to number one.
Number one is really sales and I. and focusing yourself on prospects and
don't don't only focus on customer journeys. And that is the kind of
influence that I have, you know, that I can send emails to product owners
and tell them, OK, ifwe look at your backlog, I think that this should be
top priority for you.
G Giovanna 6:48
So let me just go over a bit ofwhat you said to make sure that I
understood clearly. So, uh, you, you own the app and the chatbot. Um,
these do not, uh, directly influence the acquisition f
unnel, but it has a
very key and strategic role in engaging and throughout the customer
journey in their life, uh, lifetimevalue, right, uh, whenever they are, um,
related to Watfo. But you also have the mandate to support on other
teams and departments KPIs or targets by um advising or by uh telling
your agile teams to understandwhat are or to redefine their priorities or
what they should be focusing on. Yes, and uhwhen you talk about this,
this team of of of sustainability, theseuh sustainability advisory, you see
that they play not only a role in upselling or cross selling for for current
customers, but you also believe that they have a key play in acquisition
and bringing new prospects.
F Fleur 7:57
Absolutely, yeah, correct, um, and then you said you don't have these
these commercial targets as KPIsfor your team.
G Giovanna 8:05
But then what are the main KPIs that your team is measured against?
Um, andwe can, we don't have to bevery specific if you don't want to
go over the scorecard, but, uh, just to understand, are these related to
engagement, are these related related to Um, extending lifetimevalue,
uh, cross sell well, cross sellingwould be commercial, but, uh, what is it,
um, that you take on and that kind of guide your teams and your agile
teams through?
F Fleur 8:37
Uh, yeah, we, we have been discussing, uh, digital KPIsfor quite a long
timewith lot of phone, and it's kind of hard to um get that because of
the democratized part and the fact that digital is spread throughout the
organization it's really difficult. To have really specific digital KPIs uh for,
for, for my uh department. So what wewhat we do have as aKPI is, for
example, access, and that is the amount of customers having a mile
accounts divided by the base.
F Fleur 9:19
So that is um that is aKPI I have. Um, so I haveKPIs on our four strategic
pillars, climate champion, excited customers, people fit for the f
uture,
and smart value steering.
F Fleur 9:35
So if I look at the smart value steering, um I have the part that entails
automation, um, so I have saved hours. So I have a target of how many
saved hours of of
um in terms of. Cost to serve savings, I realize. I also
have I steered the IT project budget.
F Fleur 10:01
So I look at all the millions being spent and I need to make sure that all
the teams don't, you know, end their yearly spendwithin 2% of that
target. Uh, which is quite a big operation allocating IT in the proper way,
right, in terms of cost, yeah, yeah, like each team is hiring a lot of
developers and uh overall teams we need to finish on target with respect
to the project spend, the budget that we have, and I also have a target of
cost to serve divided by contracts.
F Fleur 10:40
OK. So, yeah, so this is really, so there's quite a lot of cost steering in my
value steering. I thought I also had a churn, and I think for next year I
need to have churn as well because of the engine. So what you see is
that um, yeah, I don't have like acquisition or sales targets myself.
G Giovanna 11:01
OK. So, so when it comes to when it comes to growth targets, these are
the ones that you share across all the other departments, right? You
contribute to acquisition or you contribute to, uh, to retention, but not
necessarily is what your your team is measured against.
F Fleur 11:19
Exactly, because my team doesn't have any influence on on the on the
sales targets, that's really scope. Uh, my team does have influence, for
example, on the term reduction, uh, via the business case of the engine
project. So, so yeah, I'm actually missing that one and Iwant to add that
one for next year.
F Fleur 11:41
Yeah, yeah, and then then I have access. I haveuh also uh relational NPS
to customer satisfaction, but also customer satisfaction of the app,
customer satisfaction of
Mina. What I also look at isf
uturevalue
solutions, so I also contribute to the development of sustainability
propositions and and services that Johan vanLoan's team is developing
and CO2reduction as well.
G Giovanna 12:13
Brilliant. OK, so in the strategic level of sustainability, there's a lot right
to contribute to.
F Fleur 12:19
Yeah, yeah, brilliant.
G Giovanna 12:21
And um if you look at, if you picture about phone in 5years, what would
you like to see differently? We know that there is avery clear uhvision
set up uh for 2030or 2027, 2027. I know that there is avery clear vision.
Um, if you stretch it a bit, how do you see, how would you like to see
Wattenfo? Like, what is your vision for the company? What, what is the
type of role that you thinkattenfall should be playing?
F Fleur 12:51
Well, what Iwould love is to really have like the segmented approach. I
would love for our company to look at the markets, so all the prospects,
and to have these segmented into a potential value, and Iwould love for
us to do the same thingwith our current customers, with our base. And
uh Iwould think that wewould be really successf
ul if
uh for our current
customers and our and the prospects that we could really be able to
offer them um uh interesting sales and serviceuhuh that that that are
really personalized for their own situation.
F Fleur 13:35
And I thinkwe need to shift from a one size fits all into the area of
personalization and do this in a coordinatedway across all our channels.
So ifwewould reach, ifwe ifwewould succeed in this, then I thinkwe
wewould be avery successf
ul company.
G Giovanna 13:53
Brilliant, and yeah, and uh just to be clear, right now we're far from this.
F Fleur 13:58
Yeah, right now, we are far from this, and one of the key challenges I see
is theway that we are organized.
F Fleur 14:06
So I spokewith Wilco and uh for the for the long term stream of this
project, the Sunrise project, I think that you guys are also advising on
the organization, right, on the organization structure.
G Giovanna 14:25
It is a limited limited recommendation, but for sure this is going to be
part of
uh of our indications of North Star for sure. Yeah, yeah,
interesting. OK, brilliant.
F Fleur 14:37
Yeah, because, because my feeling is that we, because everybody's
working on their own silos, wewill never be able to have a look at really
these customer segments and and provide these customer segments
through throughout thewhole journey. Throughout all the content,
throughout all the campaigning, throughout it, you know, all the touch
points in their whole customer journey, thewhat they really need.
F Fleur 15:03
Yeah, well, maybe maybe it's not necessary yet to reach most of our
targets, but yeah.
G Giovanna 15:10
Yeah, but this unifiedvision of
uh customer journeysfrom a customer
point ofview, these are key for sure, to be able to to extend this lifetime
value, um.
F Fleur 15:21
And, andwhat we, we do haveuh some. Someway of doing this, right,
but it's not integral.
F Fleur 15:29
And so we see a small islandwithin the, within customer experience
management, uh, doing somethingwith customer journeys, then the
campaigning team in Yolanda is also doing somethingwith customer
journeys, but these two silos don't really align together and they're not
really looking at the same segments either, or they're not using the same
modeling for these customer journeys either.
G Giovanna 15:58
Andwhy andwhy do you think so, sir? I'm, I'm super curious now, why
do you think this happens?
F Fleur 16:05
Uh, well, I think that part of the problem is, is that the the theway that
the company is being steered, right, the targets and the mandates and
the, the, the, yeah.
F Fleur 16:18
These are in different parts of the organization, so they are all, they all
have the liberty and freedom of doingwhat they want. Yeah. And, and
my, from a business architecture point ofview, I'm stuck in the middle
trying to align everybody. Like, for example, the journey topic logging
that we're implementing for the chatbot Coy, Iwant the same journey
topic logging model as the one that they'reusingwithin customer
experience management for in a tool that they're going to implement for
customer journeys.
F Fleur 16:50
Yeah, so I'm trying to place my architects and and to create awareness
on uh on the level of the directors. Hey, please make sure that what
we're doing here aligns withwhat we're doing there, so that in the end, if
we create a databasewith all kinds of data, that at the one channel will
be able to map onto the other channel.
G Giovanna 17:10
And, and how's that going? I'm curious now.
F Fleur 17:14
Uh, it was challenging. I think that we, we're making progress, uh, that
thewillingness and the collaboration is there, but, uh, I think that
Sometimes with this we maybe don't have the right governance or the
right structurewithin our company to do this in an appropriateway.
G Giovanna 17:35
OK, clear.
F Fleur 17:36
I find that challenging, yeah.
G Giovanna 17:39
Clear, um, moving a bit now to the ambitions to thevisions that were
said and a bit ofwhat we discussed, um, during the kickoff, uh, we see
that clear graph and moving from ENG towards solutions and then
ultimately to him. Um, And uh could you elaborate a bit more about
around this ambition um for solutions, um, and um what is thewhat is
the the current vision that we have for this and specifically for him and
um.
G Giovanna 18:15
What, what is still lacking for us to reach this? Because, uh, just a quick
um quick one on at least defining priorities and defining, for instance,
um, customer segments or who shouldwe beuh targeting right now, at
least with this project, is there is a a dividedvision of Attracting these
100to 100, 1500new customers, who should those be? There is already
avery big difference and should be, shouldwe be talking about really
traditional customers or shall we be looking at the f
uture and then
talking to customers that are more open to solutions to sustainability uh
offerings and so on. So, can you tell us a bit ofwhat is this um ambition
of moving towards solutions andwhat are the challenges that we're
facing there? Uh, where shall we be focused?
F Fleur 19:17
Uh, well, I think one of the main challenges is that uhwhat we need to be
able to reach is not quantified. So we always talk about getting twice our
fair share of electrical vehicle, uh, high energy, right? But what, what is
this exactly, right? How many customers do we need to attract on our
proposition? And let's calculate this. Hey, let's let's make it tangible. And
let's say ifwe have calculated this amount of customers, then we could
probably backyard calculatewith conversions, how many customers do
we need to target.Then the next question isfor, OK, we need to target
these customers, where, where are these customers? How, how can we
identify these customers in our, in our leads and in our salesf
unnel? And
I think that's the exercise that we need to be doing here. Um, so you
guys are the expert on growth, but this is the this is the part that I'm
completely lackingwithin what fall. And um yeah, I think that that's what
we need to do. So we know
um ifwe look at the market, we know what
kind of percentage to have a traditional electricity and gas household.
We know how many customers cannot afford any sustainability
solutions. We know how this is going to progress within 2030because
Christa and Sven's team have calculated this. Uh, but what does this
really mean for us as a company, right? How arewe going to shift our
targeting as a consequence? What kind of numbers do we need to
reach, andwhat will be our concrete sales strategy to be able to do so?
F Fleur 21:03
And I think this is something that that we need to develop.And then the
next question is, OK, ifwe have all these numbers, ifwe have all these
targets, what kind of teams do we need to have in place to be able to
reach this goal, right? What kind of expertise do we need? How many
FTEs do we have? So let's let's haveLet's calculate how many
manpower and andwhat kind of organization we need to to to achieve
this. And does this matchwithwhat Yolanda has in Peru uh because my
feeling is that 80or 90% of the effort that we have commercially is still
on traditional energy and gas. And does that really matchwith the
strategy that we have? Question mark.
F Fleur 21:57
And, and you know, this is not my scope and Joan. So I mean this is not,
this is commercial. So I'm kind of giving you
what my
view is on what
commerce should be doing, but this is not my scope of my work. Yeah,
but, but in the scope of your work, it's very much related to that, to that,
right, where then you allocate resources, how do you contribute to to
those goals, which is interesting.
F Fleur 22:23
but I think that the scope of my work is really providing the technology
to be able to do so. So from my perspective, you know, engine is starting
to to be there from a technological perspective, and now we have the
people in process part that that any adoption, any implementation, that's
where that's where the real challenge is going to be the next 2or 3
years.
R Raban 22:49
Maybe one question from my side, the Fleur, um, you told us that you're
workingwithuhJuan Don also on the sustainability propositions and
services. OK, can you elaborate a bit more on what's going on currently
there andwhat's thevision for the new propositions?
F Fleur 23:04
Uh, well, you learn from CSA, he has awhole year plan on what hewants
to achieve on each sustainability uh topic. And he has clear targets on
what hewants to achieve, and um yeah, some of the scope is in my agile
teams to realize. For example, immobility is an agile team that I have.
The sustainability advice is a team I have. And also, if you look at home
energy management, this is also something that the architects are
working on. And that's the scope that my team hasfor this part.
R Raban 23:41
Yes, indeed. And then you're also again involved in the, the digital
enablement of those propositions, but vo is defining them from a
customer andvalue perspective. Yeah, yeah, and I also make sure that
theseum um.
F Fleur 23:57
Because thevalue of these, uh, if you look at all the millions that the
company is making, is so much smaller, but it's a strategicvalue.
F Fleur 24:09
So, yeah, so what I make sure that also from a portfolio perspective that
we have a tactical portfolio team, TEPO it's called, and my team is also
owner of the TAPO, and this is um this is um in the governance meeting
where our N minus 3management layer is in. And all new initiatives go
through an intake, and they are being prioritized in the TPO for allocation
of teams and resourcing. And that's that's also something that I have in
my in my mandate. My my manager Iduna Fullingha is the owner of the
TEEO. So what I do is that I make sure that I have a few agile teams
contributing to sustainability portfolio, but I also have the tactical
portfolio ofwhere I make sure that they get priority and I allocate
privacy, security, and business architecture resources. To these
initiatives, yeah, and if you talk about the portfolio in this case, that is
the sustainability portfolio where that process is in place.
F Fleur 25:21
It's called Tati portfolio over, andwe do all our portfolio management in
this meeting. OK, so we have every quarter we have. We have a road
map of all the initiatives that we are doing andwe get this approved in
our in our leadership team.
R Raban 25:43
Andwhat's the scope of that, of that portfolio?
F Fleur 25:46
Uh, I, I can show you.
R Raban 25:51
Iwas trying to understand because you
were told need also about how
the channels are divided across uh owners and that you have a specific
focus in that.
F Fleur 26:01
Yeah, Iwill, uh, um, Iwill show you.
R Raban 26:06
And then maybe after that, we can talk a bit about the digital strategy.
F Fleur 26:15
And you see my screen? Not yet.
G Giovanna26:18
Yeah, now we get it.
F Fleur 26:20
OK, so this is uh from strategy, this is what this is also what I do from
strategy to execution. So takinguhwhat we do and making it tangible.
F Fleur 26:32
Uh, so it's the portfolio planning and the roadmap for the for the quarter.
Every quarter, I, uh, my team is, is, is submitting this. Uh, so herewe
have all our prioritiesfor, uh, this is the realization of our Q3priorities. So
we have all the projects ISO, Miami, smart allocation, one stop shop, etc.
This is all kind of like our own company jargon. But these are all like the
big projects and the big initiatives that we're doing engineers here as
well. Wewent livewith thewelcomes journey.
F Fleur 27:07
Uh, so we're doing a lot, and this is to streamline, you know, what our
company should be focusing on becausewe have quite a lot of agile
teams and a lot of initiatives that we areworking on. And then we have a
proposition of the prioritiesfor Q4. Andwhat is really important, what is
our top 5, to be able to create focus on the teams. And the rest of our
portfolio, everything that we are doing. So this is wherewe do really the
steering on all these things. Herewe have all kinds of new initiatives in
Q1, and all these initiatives require resourcing from. From, yeah, from,
from, from our teams. What we also did is that uhwe divide these into
uhvalue steering into the strategic pillars, andwhat we do is that we
have them in terms of phasing, scoping, realization, and go to market.
F Fleur 28:12
And so here you see all the different initiatives.
R Raban 28:19
All the tougher time, yeah, and that's the scope of this customer and
solutions to the Netherlands, or is it, is it broader than that?
F Fleur 28:28
Um, we do this specifically for B2C, for consumer market, but uh, yeah,
andwe also have thisfor the business market.
F Fleur 28:40
Yeah, and once a quarter, we align for what we're doing in the consumer
market with business market becausewe also have some projects that
We do in common, quite a few actually, becausewe're in consumer
market, we're quite bigger than business market, so they piggyback on
all kinds of products that we're doing, for example, for security and
compliance and stu
ff like that, like ISO or a project that we're doing for
access management, that kind of stu
ff. Yeah. And there, just one last
question beforewe move to digital strategy, um.
G Giovanna29:13
How do you
what are the main criteria for you to prioritize? Because I
know there is a balance between what brings growth now or or what
brings revenue now, what is growth in the f
uture? How do you balance
this out? How is this division?
F Fleur 29:28
Uh, I think that, um, we've had so many conversations about this Jovana.
So first we had the gold, silver, bronze methodology and everything
ended up in, in gold. So it was. useless basically, and now they've
implemented kind of a point system. Um, so those specific details at
some point I got so annoyed. Uh, I, I, I let them to my portfolio manager
Iduna. So if you
want specifics on that, I think that, you know, you could,
you could talk to her, but Basically what I thinkwe should be doing is to
have like the strategy and based on the strategic pillar, define kind of
metrics and have avalue for these strategic pillars on 30%, 40% of how
much they should beweighing in. Every initiative comes in, we rate
them, and then, you know, we have thevalue. And then we can score
them in terms of t-shirt sizing on how much effort it costs, and then you
just do the effort divided by the by thevalue, and then you do, you know,
from the highest score to the lowest, and that's classic portfolio
management. Um, so we know etc. and this is something that, you know,
I do not should be doing. And it's probably interesting as well to have a
look at the commercial things, how how are how are these rated.
Currently now, what happens is that They come always as scud rockets,
so from a cave and say, 00, a new priority, we need to, you know, all
hands on deck, and this is the most important bomb, and this is how
they manage it. This is how it's been done for the last I have to say this
is, this is very common, so it doesn't, it doesn't it doesn't surprise me.
F Fleur 31:18
So really that's the dynamics and um yeah, but I mean I've been portfolio
manager myselfwithin KPNwith a much larger scope, so I know all the
ins and outs of how it should be done. And slowly but surely we are
making to improve this and sometimes you know likeum I think that
good is good enough, you know, ifwe know what we're doing andwhy
we're doing it and ifwe have the right priorities, then I don't care so
much about like avery detailed and correct model as long as our
company is doing the right thing.
G Giovanna 31:57
brilliant. Let's uh let's go a bit under, um, I'm sorry, into uh digital
strategy then. So thevision as beinguh powering the transition by 2027
and now we have 55or 65, strategic pillars, right, to achieve this, that,
that being personal personalization at scale, which is a bit, well, it's a lot
ofwhat you talked about right in terms ofwherewe should be. Flexible
energy solutions, AI powered automation, customer-centric innovation
and f
utureproof landscape.
G Giovanna 32:32
Um, can we, can you elaborate on these and how, how we cameup with
these five pillars and uhwhen you, when you look at um. The current
state ofwhat we are focused on as Vattenfa. What are the things that
are the most important, what are things that we're doing to base these
uh these priorities and so on.
F Fleur 32:55
Sure, um, yeah, as I mentioned before, our personalization at scale is
really movingup the personalization, uh, and, and to move away from
one size fits all into um better customer journeys and campaigns, etc.
F Fleur 33:13
So, um, and also I think as mentioned in the slide, enrich customer data
and and tailor these propositions and communications to the customers,
uh, um, and for this we've started the engine program, um, also together
with Accenture Songwith Peter VonRey.
F Fleur 33:32
Uh, I think now about 3.5years along the road, uh, we've implemented
quite a lot that we need in our IT infrastructure to be able to do this. So
now we have a consent management solution, which is one trust, which
is a SAS solution that we rely on. We are looking at the mandates on how
to um you know, be smart, how to really eliminate as many opt-outs as
possible. It's also very important.
F Fleur 34:10
And um I think that's the next challenge that we have is really about the
people and process of how in our way ofworking, we can really get the
most out of the Adobe experience management platform that we've
implemented.OK.
F Fleur 34:30
So we've gone livewith thewelcomes journey. We're going to go live in
the summer with the prolongation journey, and then I think the next big
ticket should really be acquisition on how we can leverage these
platforms and this technology to really improve our acquisition for for
prospects through personalization through personalization, one
question.
R Raban 34:55
Uh for these customer journeys, um, are like they find in documentation
as well, can we, can we see the, the key journeys?
F Fleur 35:05
That's a good question. I've always been kind of amazed uhwhy
customer experience management did not have these journeys. And this
is really a question that you should be asking Elaine B.
F Fleur 35:19
OK, yeah, she's responsible for customer journeys.
G Giovanna 35:22
OK, yeah, that's it.
G Giovanna 35:25
That's a a good guideline for us. Um, when we look, so. When I look at
these 5priorities or these 5pillars. Um, I can see mostly growth and
personalization and flexible energy solutions and also in customer
centric innovation. Am I correct to say this, to say this?
F Fleur 35:50
Uh, yeah, you are correct, because AI powered automation is mainly
about improving NPS and reducing costs. Futureproof landscape is
really to, to have this long term vision on what we're doingwith our
portfolio and how we're managing our IT expenses. And how we can
build on our f
utureproof solutions. It's also very important to me, um, if
we look at growth, what kind of capabilities do we need and how do they
map to existing systems or what do wewhat do we need additionally to
be able to enable this, and I understood from that and from Vil also that
they are looking into this. Yeah, So f
utureproof landscape is really
important for me, and that's really what I expect from this project is I
would love to hear from you guys in terms of f
uture proofness, how are
we doing, what kinds of tips do you have, what arewe missing, because
then I can really Start building a case to to to start investing in that area
morewith respect to the IT budget, with respect to our technology.
F Fleur 37:11
And my
view of how we're saying is we're not doing badwith in terms of
how
f
utureproofwe are, but that's also an important one.The customer
centric innovation is really about how can we build that on our customer
experience optimization, how can we, what is thevision on our on our
UX and our design. The lead designer in my team has avision, and he's
rolling out, um, let's say, um. A design system. He's implementing this
within front end development, and he has very specific pillars that he's
working on. For example, the accessibility is also important for us to get
as a certification. OK. Uh, so when we look at the customer centric
organization andwhat we're doing there is that as well, and currently the
the designer team is really spread across the organization and it's not
centralized. So it has been quite challenging in the last few years to
professionalize this. OK. Andwe have a lot of external UX designers as
well. So for us it's quite hard to uh to make fast progress on this topic.
G Giovanna 38:34
And so, when we, when we expand a bit on the UXCI of the platforms
and so on, when we talk about research, andwhen we talk about,
becauseuhwhenever we look at the pipeline of innovation, there are
ways um. There are different sources of innovation, right? There's so
there's technology, there's vision from leadership, there is um um
optimization. There's always um coming from a customer unmet needs,
right? This is a big source of innovation. How well are you arewe doing
about this? Um, and, um, do we do anything at all when it comes to
customer panels, uh. Uh, developing new
value propositions or new
offerings, um, can you tell us a bit about this?
F Fleur 39:20
Yeah, I can send you this presentation. Uh, I have a presentation on UX
research. OK.
F Fleur 39:27
So, uh, this is also an initiative that we've started, um, how do weum Uh,
yeah, what is our current situation? How do we listen to our customers,
what's in data? What is our ambition, um, which steps shouldwe be
takingwhen it comes to UX research? Um, ifwe look at customer centric
innovation, uh, what kind of projects arewe having now, um, andwhat
we have a roadmap with respect to the coming.
F Fleur 40:01
A quarters what we're doing. Yeah, I could actually ask my design to
update this and I can send this uh this pack to you if you like.
G Giovanna 40:11
Yeah, this would bevery helpf
ul. Thank you. OK. And uhwhen it comes
to uh back to the five pillars, when it comes to flexible energy solutions,
um, can you guys guideus through there? What does that mean and
what are the most important initiatives?
F Fleur 40:28
Oh, if you could put the slide back on, that would beusef
ul.
F Fleur 40:33
Yeah, sorry, ping ponging yeah.
F Fleur 40:44
Um, yeah, this is really about being able to bundle solutions sold, andwe
had some ambitions this year, and I must say that we're not making
good enough progressfrom my perspective, and I think it's part of the
challenge. I also think it's that, um, well, maybe our target setting is not
being scared on enough. So I do think that CSD, you alone and you
longer have targets on bundles, but I don't have any
visibility on how
goodwe're doing, etc.
F Fleur 41:25
For me, what's really important is about creating an ecosystem of
partners that we could really plug and play through a layer of APIs and
these different partners able to to create a richer offering to our
customers, and that's what we really successf
ully managed to do so
with respect to our immobility portfolio. And this isfor me like a really a
success story of how we should beworking instead of developing
everything ourselves, we can quickly create this ecosystem of partners
via an API layer and position ourselves as the people having the
customer relationship through our app and throughuh through, through
our customer, the customer information. So we need to be owner of the
contracts, uh, but we can have, let's say, um, yeah, this partnership with
different companies, um, while being owners of the contract. So this is
really thevision also for home energy management on how we should be
doing this. And this isfor mevery exciting because this is kind of
knowledge that we are developingwithin within our company. And yeah,
that's that's wherewewant to move in at. This is like the plug and play
insights available in the app, and being able to, to, to quickly add new
partners or divest partners wherewe see fit because the environment
that we areworking on as the energy industry is really
very dynamic. So
we need to have thisflexibility, and that's why we call it flexible, because
we need to be able to adapt and to quickly innovate. And this is where
speed and is very crucial, andwe need to have quick time to market on
this as well.
G Giovanna 43:22
Yeah, for sure. And uh Iwould assume that this impacts a lot of
uh your
mandate but also your, your efforts, right, when it comes to developing
these APIs and this layer of integration with this uh landscape. So I'm
also, I'm also assuming that there is not much happening yet apart from
the mobility, um, in terms of solutions that you need to prioritize.
F Fleur 43:46
Uh, yeah, and it's also, uh, it's really dependent on regulatory climate, if
we, ifwe see, for example, so dating that these new laws are going to
take place, then quickly we could see, for example, a lot of customers
buying batteries. And if a lot of customers are going to buy batteries,
bomb, this is something that we need to be able to support. So then we
need to be able to, let's say, plug and play, add the batteries to our
ecosystem, and be able to manage these batteries, you know, in
combination with solar panels, for example, and you know, be able to
charge or dearge this when the market prices are high or low, and this is
all f
unctionality that wewant to develop. So from my perspective, it's
very interesting to look at, OK, um What piece is ours andwhat do we
rely on with respect to partners, what do we do with hardware, etc. etc.
etc. it's quite fascinating and also the infrastructure part is also
something that we as a retail company in the supply chain that we are
reliant on. So also these developments also come into play. So that's
really the I call it the back end of our of our company. So it's all about
sourcing the energy, but also about the net network congestion and and
what are the infrastructureum.
F Fleur 45:25
Yeah, what are the, what is the infrastructure going to do about this?
G Giovanna 45:31
Um, what about any other questions around the, the five pillars?
R Raban 45:36
No, I, no question. Maybe just, just for, for care, make sure I, I
understand correctly, um, in thevision slides of herewe saw that, that,
um, yeah, Fool is choosing a routeum where they workwithuh hardware
um partnersfor hardware, right? Um, so, so, so. sees itself moving
forward indeed the only the customer relationships, and the domain
expertise. uh, but when it comes to hardware specifically for infra
energy infrastructure, uh, therewill be away to partners to expand their.
F Fleur 46:14
Yeah, do you, you agree on that, on that direction? Yeah, absolutely,
absolutely. For example, we rely on a partner called Ael for our charging
stationsfor mobility. And this is something that we rely on for partners
as they have much better skillsfor installation, andwewant to be
flexible to be able to divest and move to another company if there are
innovations on the hardware part and the hardware is not core business
for Waterfall, but the energy that we are supplying to these charging
stations, that is core businessfor waterfall. Same thing goesfor home
energy management. Uh, ifwe look at all the, they call it industrial
informers, um, for boilers or for solar panels, there are so many different
hardware available currently on the market. That this is something that is
there's no harmonization yet, and that kind of makes it difficult to
innovate on, but that's not something that wewewewe as an energy
company see as our core business. Yeah, now clear.
R Raban 47:30
I understand this and for the software part and the IT, how do you see
this balance moving forward? What is typically something that will do
themselves andwhat's typically where they need help from partners.
F Fleur 47:44
Yeah, that's that's also somethingvery interesting to uh to always look
at that. What, what do we insource in terms of software development
andwhat do we outsource, uh, what do we make proprietary, what do
we develop ourselves, andwhat do we buy as a SAS solution, uh. Uh,
and, and there are also, we need to focus on our core business, andwe
need to seewhat is strategically important for us.
F Fleur 48:13
And also in terms of the data, which data isfor us, andwe need to have
ourselves andwhich data doesn't matter, andwe can We can have
sitting at a partner. Yeah.
R Raban 48:28
Yeah, this is something also that is currently exploringwhere, where the
balance is is most optimal moving forward, or is there already a clear
vision on this?
F Fleur 48:38
Um, I don't, well, there are different visions on this, but we, um, I think
that we look at every topic and then we decide on on how to move
forward. And sometimes it's also a matter of regulations as well. For
example, we developed our e-commerce platform.
F Fleur 49:02
How we call it now. Well, we call the project a one-stop shop, but it's the
energy shop, I thinkwe call it now.
F Fleur 49:10
And uhwe decided that we don't want any customer data on the
platform.
F Fleur 49:16
So wework really with the tokenization, we keep all the customer data
within our own landscape, andwe don't supply the platform with any
customer information. Yeah.
F Fleur 49:28
So and that really depends on, you know, on every supplier and the
technical setup and the legal legal setup as well.
R Raban 49:39
Yeah, exactly. And also then for for the flexible energy solutions, of
course, depends on the solution or the offering, how that decision is
being made in or outsource it one last question on this strategic
strategic please.
G Giovanna 49:56
Can you tell us about the past 3years pipeline, uh, in terms ofwhat were
the initiatives that were focused um on by by by your department and by
the company itself. And uhwhether they succeeded, what were the
things that that got in theway, uhwhat were initiatives that in the middle
were deprioritized? Can you tell us because part of the the challenge
that we're facing is they never talk about growth and growth strategy in
these initiatives, we know that a lot has been made and and uh the
decisions aroundwhich initiatives to put forward, uh, have been made as
well, but we're really trying to understandwhat were the most relevant
ones andwhy didn't they work or why they worked. So can you tell us
about the most successf
ul and the least successf
ul initiatives when it
comes to innovation, uh, in the past 3years.
F Fleur 50:48
Well, the least successf
ul for me is really um um the, the, well, the
dynamic pricing, uh, flex price. Because therewhat we saw is that we
already wanted to launch this, I think in the summer of 2022. That's
where the ideas came across. Then it kind of, nothing happened to it
because therewas no intake from an innovation perspective from the
commercial side. And then uh in the middle of the of the energy crisis in
January 2023, Anvibe launched it and uhwe had an enormous amount
of churn of these type of customers. They all went to the Anvibe and to
the companies offering this.
F Fleur 51:38
So it so it was, it was not a relevancy type.
G Giovanna 51:42
It was, it was avery clear need and it was avery um clear opportunity
that we saw. It was really on theum orchestrating the effortsfrom the
company towards this and actually executing it. It wasn't. It wasn't
because it wasn't attractive to the market, it was just a time time to
market.
F Fleur 52:03
No, no, I think that the biggest mistakewas really not recognizing the
importance of thisfrom a commercial perspective and from John and
Yolanda, not giving the order, OK, we need this, we need this
proposition. They didn't they didn't, and you know, they are the owners
of the commercial offerings, so they should have taken the decision and
they should have initiated much quicker the intake of this innovation.
F Fleur 52:34
So they waitedway too long. So this was really for me a strategic miser
strategic.
F Fleur 52:44
And then onceweuh oncewe startedwith this, it took another year to to
realize this andwith all the Uh, the thoroughness that wewanted to
implement this, and by the timewe implemented it, the prices went
down and all the traction on this proposition, you know, fell away.
F Fleur 53:07
So in the first month that we launched it, we, we had maybe 55
customers asking for for this this proposition, and it costs us a lot of
money to enter, right and um and loss in the customer customer base as
well.
G Giovanna 53:23
OK.
F Fleur 53:25
Yeah, no, but the trendwas when it, when it was really in demand and at
the right time, our competition launched it. And once all the customers
that were interestedwere gone, we launched it way too late and then
you know, the prices went down and thewhole market was not
interested in that. Proposition anymore. So we had avery expensiveuh
innovation that we launched a year too latewithvery little customers on
it. So for me that was the, yeah, one of the things that illustrates how we
missed the boat.
G Giovanna 54:06
Yeah, clear, thanks. Um, I have one question in mind, but uh sincewe
only have 44minutes left, I'm wondering if there, if you have a different
take on this, if there's anything that you should, that you
would like to, to
focus on.
R Raban 54:23
And let's uh let'sfocus on your questions here brilliant, yeah, so, uh, I
think, uh, Fleur, we already spoke a lot about um.
G Giovanna 54:32
What's in there, uh, what are the challenges, but, and, and you said like,
um, we also expect you guys to tell us what is the gap in capabilities,
internal um development or whatever that wewe have to have in place,
right, to make sure that we gain traction, um.
G Giovanna 54:51
And, and, um, yeah, and realize this growth, uh, from your perspective,
what is missing in terms of capability? If you look internally, I think there
are, I think the challenges in orchestration is clear and prioritization,
maybe it's clear. What else arewe lackingwithin Bafa?
F Fleur 55:12
Um, well, we're lackinguh the right skills and knowledge and people to
um leverage the Adobe experience management platform. So currently
we have a plan to to see how, yeah, what kind of transformation is
necessary on that perspective.
F Fleur 55:34
I think that's uhum I thinkwe lack also a central um organization where
all UX designers are in one team. That's also something that I think is um
what we're lacking.
F Fleur 55:50
Um, Yeah.
F Fleur 55:57
I think, I think from my perspective that those are the two most uh Yeah,
the two points that are most important for me.
G Giovanna 56:08
Um, OK, I think I'm gonna give you 2minutes back, but before this, um,
we have still quite a few questions. I think these are gonna be answered,
uh, along the, the project. I know we have been demanding a lot of your
time and uh thank you so much for being flexible and uh and of course,
givingus your precious um timeum along theway. Um, so if there are
any questions, is it OK ifwe send you through email or um teams, um,
anything that, um, yeah, and in any way so that we can get enough, um.
Um, input from this and, um, well, Jovanna, if I, if I may say so, Iwould
love, uh, I think the questions are good, so that's wewill absolutely try
and see how we can answer them, but please don't send them to me.
F Fleur 56:56
Send them toMinches. So I haveMichael Vess working on this project.
M can help you guys out. Uh, and I also need to have a look at what kind
of sessionsfrom this project Iwill be involved in or not, because as you
see on our roadmap, I'm in a lot of steering committeesfor a lot of
projects, and I, I need to choosewisely on how I spend my time. Yeah, I
think, I thinkwe have a, we have a plan andwe have added you to all of
them.
G Giovanna 57:23
Iwas in touchwithMaria, but uh then uh in touchwith Angelica, um. To
kind of coordinate this, I think most important, uh, Fleur would be to
have you in a steer committee more than uh in a hands on, um,
workshops, uh, which are longer. So let's, I'm I'm, I'm in touchwith her
and I'm gonna try to orchestrate to make sure that both you and Yolanda
are in the same room andwe havewe can have these conversations on
key um moments in time. So, um, I'll speak to her. Please feel free to also
say, uh, decline or not, um. And uh for me, the most important um key
moments are really when we need to challenge our approach and our
outcomes, andwewould love to hear from you.
F Fleur 58:08
Yeah, because that'sfine. Iwould love also to to hear the progress of the
project and and to seewhat kind of outcomes and how we can
challenge those, so please do invite me for that, but I'm not able to
attend all theworkshops, etc. it's not feasible. Um, so, you know,
preferably once a month, uh, one hour or so would be fine. Um, uh, but,
but if you request all these, because I think I also have all kinds of
placeholders on Wednesday afternoon, but I cannot attend these either.
G Giovanna 58:41
OK, OK, um. Should I, should I orchestrate this withMaria?
G Giovanna 58:50
Or withwith the jellya or with you.
F Fleur 58:53
No, well, if you, if you, if you let me know
uhwhat what steer, etc. you
have in mind, because Angelica cannot cannot decide that for me.
G Giovanna 59:02
OK, yeah, so, um, I'm going to send you an email right away with all the
options and the prioritize sessions that I need from you.
F Fleur 59:10
Yeah, yeah, if you could send me an overview and you can tell me, but
also what is the goal of meeting or what is being discussed in the
meeting, then then I can decidewhich one Iwill attend andwhich one I
will not.

R-Raban - Interviewer 0:00
NGO. And uh so I'm really happy to bewith you here today at the
meeting. And uh thanksfor making timeuh that we can interview you.
Um We prepared a, a bit of a protocol, of course, the script with
questions and I'm going to guide you through that. Uh You're actually
the first one on the interview list. Uh Weuhwe recently started so super
excited to really dive into uh the, the, theworld of Vool. Um Yeah, could
you maybe to start uh briefly share your journey uh thisfall and, and the
responsibilities of your current role?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 0:31
Uh I started in photo falls six years ago as a strategist in this business
unit. And two years ago, I took over the leadership of our team.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 0:41
So I'm now director of strategy for uh customers and now same
business unit as Yolanda is in. So I'm a peer to Yolanda and the
management team.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 0:51
And uh basically, very simply my job is to tell the organization where to
go and make sure that we get there.

R-Raban - Interviewer 1:00
Awesome.
R-Raban - Interviewer 1:02
It sounds like an exciting job and especially uh especially also someone
like you that could help us. I think in cos shaping this strategy moving
forward, I think a lot is already uhuh beingworked on in Fo and also
talking to Paul and Vilko. We've heard about a lot of research and
initiatives already going on andwe are trying to bring that together and
uh together with the important stakeholders and decide on theway
forward. Um Were you already updated by any
version for on this project
or um is it not?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 1:32
So when I got your e-mail, I initially thought it was one of the 10,000
spare messages that I get every day people selling. So I deleted it, that
the stakeholder management was uh maybe not, not as good as it
should have been, but it's not you guys, but my colleagues um and I
know we had a, a couple of sessions, I think a couple of months backuh
opportunity finding sessions. I think they were calls one of the strategies
from my team participated in that seewherewe see areasfor uh
acquisition growth. But Iwasn't in those sessions. Um I had other
priorities at the time and I think I received a copy of the outcome. But to
be honest that I could uh recall the one. It's a so a, a short introduction
or uhwould certainly bewelcome.
R-Raban - Interviewer 2:35
Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. And indeed likeuh like Giovanna already
shortly shared, uh We'reworkingwith some stakeholders, Jolanda Paul.
And Wilco mainly develop a strategy both for or grow
for the longer term
and, and grow
from the shorter term. And I think one of our main
objectives really is to create avision and, and an approach to win 100to
150,000new customers in 20252026. So that's really one of the core
objectives that we have to create avision for that and, and, and define
the opportunities that will deliver that growth. Um And therefore, we are
starting our process with talking to stakeholders andwewill also be a
couple of, of
uhuhworkshops together with, with stakeholders to DS
prioritize. And then in the end, create a strategy for that. We're still really
early, early stage of that. And the scope is the Netherlands um the B to
C market. Um Yeah, and, and, and new customers. Uh so growing the
customer base PC only.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 3:41
No, no Delta, no Power beers, correct.
R-Raban - Interviewer 3:44
Yeah. Um Any additions to go hooping. And um is that for now clear
enough, then I think later on in the process, wewill also have share,
share out sessions andwewill also make sure to invite you and then we
update you on our, on our progress and findings, et cetera.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 4:01
It's already in my agenda.
R-Raban - Interviewer 4:03
Awesome. Um Yeah, for now, Iwould like to start with a bit more open
question. Um If you get your photo in five yearsfrom now. What would
you like to see?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 4:18
It's avery general question. Um Iwould like to seeus um very close to
reaching our SBGI ambitions. My team is mainly involved in sustainability
topics. I leave the sale stu
ff to Jolanda Who's much better at it than I
am? Um Most of our SPT I ambitions, Iwould like to seeus transition
from commodity salesfocused to more balanced commodity sales and
solution sales approach. Iwould like to see the NPV of our customers
not only driven and calculated over our commodities, but also over the
solutions that they own. Um withus or throughus reflecting the fact that
the market is changing and the customer is changing.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 5:17
This shouldn't, by theway come as a surprise to my colleagues because
it's basically in our strategy but not yet very implemented.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 5:26
Um But I could answer your question in 1000waysfor, for this topic.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 5:34
This is a relevant part of the, of thevision for the company.
R-Raban - Interviewer 5:38
Yeah, yeah, I am. We're just curious what uhwhat the things were that
you
would highlight when answering, answering that question. But
maybewe can go into a bit more detail at you or maybe you can share
also the slideuh number one on the screen. Um uh We have received
some documents as well, of course, uh only two days. So we had to
quickly scan through them. But I thinkwe, we covered at least some
main main slides that we also want to discuss in this interview. Um This
uh this slideum I thinkvery familiar to you becausewe are just a lot of
text.
R-Raban - Interviewer 6:13
Uh OK, even better um question about this, this overview and the
strategic direction. Um So we see basically a move from the current
situation to a to-be situation uh spanning not only E&Gbut also uh a
different and stronger role in solutions and home energy services. Um
Wewerewonderingum on solutions and home energy services. Uhwhat
is Vattenfall aiming to develop in those domains andwhat's currently on
the road map?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 6:43
The latter part, you
would have to askJeroen Falon about into the details
is my my colleague responsible for business development or solutions
development. And so he's catching the road map. We'rewe're heavily
working towardsflexible solutions, flexible charging of your EV supplying
uh the, the, the E-Boiler or the the heat boiler for, for customers who
have solar panels on their roofs able to store hot water during the times
that the sun shines and then release it when the sun does not shine.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 7:25
So that's a couple of it's a combination of software and hardware
solutions on the road map.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 7:31
Um The idea is of course, the idea behind this slide, whereas we're now
sort of focused on E&G and a little bit of solutions insulation we don't
really longer believe that solutions and solutions installation is really the,
the financial quirk for the f
uture is a one off transaction.Whereas at
least we hope home Energy management could provide the potential for
a recurring revenue model, but it needs to bevalidated in real life. Of
course. Um So, so that's the idea.
R-Raban - Interviewer 8:15
Yeah, interesting. Can you, can you tell us a bit more on your
perspective on the home energy management and the role that
Vattenfall could play there? And indeed those potential revenue streams
that you see that could be.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 8:28
First of all, the home energy management for us is a defensive move.Uh
I think there's uh probably more for us to lose than maybe to gain. So
the, the threat is that if other competitors or software companies or
other companies um grab the relationship with the customer, then they
could pushus into the role of say dumb electricity supplier that has an
effect on our margins in our position in the customer.So wewould like to
be, or wewould like to remain the connection between the customer and
the supplier, which means that we need to own the customer
relationship and that's by providing services and information. So you
could think of
um recurring revenue models or around advicewhen to
switch on your electrical appliances andwhat not.Um Of course,
installing but preferably maintaining or operating your hardware devices
um offering the software that tells you
when to switch it on, when to
switch it off and how to optimize your energy contract all the logical uh
uh possible solutions.Whereas the big challenge of course is that it's all
quite heavily data and software related and that's not wherewe are at
the forefront, Iwould say. So it's a ability gap to bridge there.
R-Raban - Interviewer 10:11
Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. And, and, and you're talking about a list of
uh I
Ds potential services. Um Is it, is there already a clear vision and
approach to, to him within Ffour or is there still a domain? There's a lot
of discussions about and not yet a clear strategy that is being executed.
UP Unnamed participant 10:30
Iwould say somewhere in between. I think my colleague Jeroen has a
very clear vision wherewe need to act first, which is on the EV side and
the, and the heating solutions side, you could think of 1000other
possibilities.And he does have a road map for, for say the next one to
maybe three years I think. Do I really have a clear sort of picture in our
headwherewe should be in 2030?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 10:58
No, I think, but do I care? No, becausewhen I look back at my own
strategy plansfrom say 2019, theworld has changed so much by, by so
many things that we didn't foresee and nobody could foresee that
strategy is also adapting to uh to the latest change. Um It's good to say
a couple of targets at a high level for 2030. But I don't really believe in a
roadmap and not in a product roadmap for such a long time, I think. And
besides, I thinkwhat our strategy team does best is like this slide shows
set in the general direction of the company. We refrain from filling in that
box with concrete solutions because that's the job of my colleague, Nick
Door. That's what hewas hired for. He, he's better informed on now that
than I am.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 12:11
Yeah, I mean, my job is to set a general direction, tell peoplewhere to go
or tell my advice of course, but generally it comes down to telling people
where to go, setting a target and it's up to them to find out how we are
going to get there. And of course, we, we offer our help and our advice
and our brains, but it's not my job to do someone else's job there and
talking about the hardware and the software part.
R-Raban - Interviewer 12:42
Um I also see on the slide that the hardware primarily through
partnerships.This is uh then also the strategic direction for the, the local
term.
R-Raban - Interviewer 12:52
OK. And, and for the software part and the digital part, uh how do you
see the balance there between what Vattenfall will andwill deliver and
how andwhere partnerships are needed to deliver.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 13:05
In all honesty. I think that's what we need to find out for - what we will
deliver and how andwhere partnerships are needed to deliver. Um, I
think software is a tricky one? Because it's rather easy to scaleup uh at
margin at zero marginal cost. Uh So the threat is potentially bigger, the
gain is also potentially bigger uh compared to solutions where there's
always manmade labor involved.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 13:36
Um But it's also the part wherewe are not exactly uhuhworking in our
sweet spot in software.I mean, so there's again, there's an ability to get
to bridge and if that means that we first um partner up and then do it
ourselves or try to do it ourselves right away, I think I'm leaning towards
the first one, but it's also something that I trust my colleague. Jeroen on
to find that out.What's the, what's the, thewisest course together with
Fleur. So long answer for? We need to find out.
R-Raban - Interviewer 14:22
Yeah. Yeah, indeed. Andwhat I noticed on this slide is that in, in the
middle, there is a part ofvalue chain sharedwith partnersfor the
solutions. You home energy services, f
ull control ofvalue chain just like
E&G could you help me to understand because there are clearly uh for
hardware and then it needs to workwith partners as well, right? The
Home Energy Services,
S- Sven - Strategy Director 14:46
Youyou know, the reason that um wewant to workwith partners in
solutions is that there are are subsidiary things that are just simply too
small despite being a market leader to help out thewhole B2C customer
base, it just doesn't fit. So we need to partner up with, with others to
make sure that we can decarbonize all our customers with, again, with
software.Iwould assume that if you have one big solution that works, I
could scale it up to anyone and to X. Um But we don't have that one. So
the end goal is to have f
ull control of that value chain because I don't
want a software company to sit in between myself and my customer.I
guess, you know, all the reasons why we shouldn't. Uh But I don't think
we'll get there in one step or in one big leap. Yeah. So again, I'm leaning
towards the model, let's partner up. But I thinkwe, we need to really
focus and, and find out which part of thevalue chain shouldwe partner
up? Which ones maybe try to leap in towards the end goal in one in one
go.Um Which ofwhere? Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera?
R-Raban - Interviewer 16:06
Yeah. Yeah. OK. Thank you, Claire for me. Um So one other question and
so I saw
um that there is um yeah, customers can be distinguished uh
based on their attitude to sustainable sustainability and solution
ownership. And therewere like eight categories um from traditional
energy homeuhwith sustainable potential to combination home and
solar, et cetera. UhMay maybeuh go slide here on talk to maybe also
share this one. Yeah, Iwas wondering becauseum in this slide, we see
uh percentages of the number of nl customers. Uh Is there aview
from
the strategy team on where most growthum might happen uh in which
segments andwhich are prioritized as well?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 16:57
That's, that's tough one. It's also a bit a little bit depending on who's uh
on the government seat in the Hague. Um So maybe a year ago, Iwould
have said uh in in solar, maybe looking at the current stage of affairs,
nothing is growing.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 17:21
But if, ifwe try to um um look through in disregard theups and downs in
a cycle, you
would expect uh substantial growth in about every bucket
EVs or a position for, for huge f
urther exponencial growth. Uh Same for
heat pumps, same for solar wherewe're far from uh satisfied or f
ulfilled
or the market is plenty of room left.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 18:00
Um So basically, Iwould issue growth in every bucket maybewith the
exception of district heating because of all the political upheaval there.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 18:11
Does this answer your question?
R-Raban - Interviewer 18:13
Yes, that answers my question. And in this case, your your your current
perspective or is there has also been done like a more detailed analysis
wherewe could also see documentation of, of these growth rates and
what is expected?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 18:26
Iwould have to check that with my team because they made the slides,
they did all the analysis stu
ff. Um, I just approved it.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 18:35
I, Iwould assume so.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 18:38
We can all draw the hockey sticks.
R-Raban - Interviewer 18:40
Yeah. Can we send the, send you an email about that?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 18:44
Sure. Yeah.
R-Raban - Interviewer 18:45
Do you can maybe make a note to send a reminder for that? Um, let's
move to the next question. Um, wewere already talking a bit, uh, uh, in
the, in theview about the strengths andweaknesses. For example, you,
you mentioned that, yeah, the, the, the, the hardware, right? That's
clearly not something that Vattenfall owns or is able to own. Um Could
you elaborate a bit more on your view on the strength andweaknesses
of Vattenfall in the market in relation to sales?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 19:15
Iwould show more marketing.
R-Raban - Interviewer 19:16
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Let's keep that scope.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 19:19
Yeah, the customer, I think theum maybe bigger strength of
business
units is uh processing large amounts of energy related data in
acceptable cost levels leading to relatively interesting margins per
customer. So you could also compareus to avery efficient building
factory.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 20:00
Uh It, it's my, it's my colleaguesfrom, from the other departments that
who actually produceuh electricity. We don't produce any gas. Uh Of
course, uhwe all buy that on the market. That's the, that's the job of the
colleagues in the, in the, in the trading floors with our business unit, we
just deliver stu
ff to the customer andwhen it comes to commodities
where I think we’re maybe the best in the Dutch market looking at our
profitability levels on a contract level.But that's also maybe one of our
weaknesses. You know, we're so focused on the E&G and it's such a
profit center that it is very hard to make the energy transition be felt at
the marketing and sales department. Jolanda knows this because it's
been avickery topic.So the battleship is turning but it's turningvery
slowly. Um And I can understand that because the solutions in home
energy management stu
ff doesn't really bring in any big money right
now, but it is the f
uture. So we're maybe not that good in finding
alternative business models. And there's also not much of an urgency to
do it because E&G is bringing in so much money.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 21:26
So without wanting to hurt Jolanda and her team, they're doing a great
job uh on earning money and getting sales through the traditional stu
ff.
But I think they're strugglingwith segmenting the market and, and
creating a non mass market, but more segmented approach to the, to
the customer base and make sure that you gets a slightly different offer
than Giovanna or Felix because you're a different person and it is now a
little bit one size fits all.It's totally true, of course. Um But I've been
asking for, for exampleMPV calculations on the household level for
some time, still zero result, but
F Felix22:21
What do you think that the tipping point will be because you say right
now it'sfocused on traditional uh resources likeuh E&G. Um And that's
theuhuhuh he is, is a, is a strategic direction. Um But it's movingvery
slowly and it doesn't haveum the, the focus right now. What would you
say? When do you say, or when would you expect to be the tipping point
for this?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 22:50
When uh no, maybe the tipping point has maybe come, it's better to ask
it to uh to Jolanda, of course, but the stills results acquisitions areway
behind business plan. It's now really starting to hurt us. And pain does
work sad to say, you know, this your consultants, usually you get called
because there's pain. Um and, andwe experience pain as an
organization, the customer base isfalling andwe can’t fix the problem.
R-Raban - Interviewer 23:27
Indeed, that's what we, what we're here for. And Felix you need to leave.
Uh I thinkuh you have some more questions, we can maybeuh focus on
you
for sure.
F Felix23:39
Now, can skip the positioninguh question and uh go to theum uh price
premium uh question.
F Felix23:49
Yeah. So this, this, this isfrom theum from the most recent KANTAR
report. I don't know if you'veuh you've probably read it. Uh Thisf
um it
says here, the energy market is, is, is, is very price driven that
consumers are, you know, very of course, very price sensitive. For
Vattenfall this uh creates a challenging situation becauseuh first of all
uh is, is, is is considered a premium price brand. So how
um do you um
handle this, this sort of disconnect between theway consumers uh pick
their energy and theway Vattenfall is perceived on a brand level?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 24:35
I don't thinkwe do at the moment.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 24:41
That would be a Vattenfall customer, maybe your onewho of you is a F
and for customer? You are maybe a question back to you. Do you, do
you
feel do you get enoughvalue back for what you pay?
F Felix24:55
Um Yeah, when I moved homes, um I um uh picked photo because it was
uh at the moment uhuh the best value plus it uh had some interesting
uh digital features. So that's why I picked it.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 25:12
Ok. How long have you been a customer now?
F Felix25:15
Two years.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 25:17
How is your feeling over the past two years? Do we succeed in making
clear what valuewe offer you? Except that the light goes on when you
switch?
F Felix25:26
I mean, it's avery low interest product um for, for, for, for, for me and for
most people at least. Uh So yeah, that's uh if it's low interest products,
but you automatically look at at price. So, exactly.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 25:42
And so, so we are a commodity. We'revery aware of that. So I think if
you
want to distinguish qualities you, you should do something about
branding and, and getting your USP clear across. So at least the barrier
for you as a customer, Felix to switch is a little bit higher than just price
because you leave a brilliant company with the brilliant ads and, and the
general good feeling that you get that you contribute to the
environment, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 26:15
I really believe that we're not very successf
ul with getting that across.
(branding)
F Felix26:20
What would you say are the key differentiators versus direct
competitors? Uh Currently um in your eyes, what would the ideal uh or
to be key differentiators should be compared to direct competitors?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 26:36
It would be nice if customers would perceiveusfor who we are. We are
very sustainable company. Much more sustainable than some of our
competitors. We build like crazy on the, on the North Sea. Green choice
doesn't giveuh doesn't do a shit. Um Some of our other competitors,
they have avery green image but they don't do shit andwework our
asses off
uh But we can, we don't get rewarded for it. So there's
something of
between the, the perception and the reality.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 27:10
We're also avery social company, but we're not perceived as one. So
again, there are a couple of gaps between image and reality and they
don't help.Uh Because if that gap is there, then the only thing you have
left Felix to, to, to, to, to evaluate your contract or no rule date is price
andwe're not definitely not the cheapest bricks, right?
F Felix27:39
Uh Well, thank you
for that. I have to drop from the call now, but it's
been really, really insightf
ul. So um it stay as a customer and if I if I if I do
leave, I'll tell you the reason why. Ok, thanks. Thank you.
G Giovanna27:57
Ok, let me, let me then ask, take over from Felix Anna's question. I think
we are talking a bit about retention here as well, right? So there is this
price sensitivity in terms of attracting new customers. But also in terms
of let me know if you, if you're going to remain a Vattenfall client, right?
So a matter of retention, how do you see both challenges andwhich one
is the biggest one so far?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 28:22
Oh, it's also one of the, the strange. Is it a dilemma? No, I I can't recall
the right word in English anyway. Um maybe contradiction.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 28:37
No, no, it's not a confrontation. It's more of like a, I don't know. Let me
explain andwe'll get there if you askJolanda. Now, how much time do
you spend on acquisition versus customer loyalty? Iwouldn't be
surprised if she says 80to 20or 90to 10. But on the other hand, we are
an incumbent. So you
would assume that we have most to gain by
keeping our customers and relatively little to gain by a heav
y acquisition
efforts. But theway we do it is exactly the other way around.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 29:23
And I know if you ask to my sourcing and pricing colleague, there's of
course 10,000valuable reasons to do that. But concept wise,
conceptually, it's completely the opposite ofwhat you
want to be. And
we do talk to a lot of customers who leaveus after 20years or so and
they say “You offer me€10to stay here and you offer€2000to a new
customer.” So what the heck?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 30:03
So apart from if the economics really work out, you could argue that uh
yeah, best acquisition strategy is avery good loyalty strategy.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 30:23
If you don't go as a customer, I don't have to acquire you.
R-Raban - Interviewer 30:26
Yeah, I think that's a fair point. Um Here you had another question on
this or um and I take back over if it'sOK. Yes.
R-Raban - Interviewer 30:38
Um So on that strategic um offer few that we presented first, um you
also saw on the Y axis that um yeah, Vattenfall aims to increase the
degree of customer targetingum over the over the next years. And um I
was wondering, of course, there's also the the powerpeers brand. Um I
think, I think you're also managing that, right? Um To what extent do you
see opportunities to launch like new
brands in linewith this ambition to
be better in consumer targetting?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 31:16
Um I don't exclude the possibility. Um but I think there's a lot to validate
.
R-Raban - Interviewer 31:36
Let me just, uh let me just go back here.
G Giovanna 31:38
So you mean, uh, Sven, you don't, you don't exclude the possibility of
launching new
brands to acquire new segmentation? Is that what you
mean?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 31:47
I don't exclude it, but it's not very likely. So there's no discussion about it
Vattenfall which I'll, I'll gladly leave it up to you to adviseus otherwise.
But officially Vattenfall has a one brand strategy so that we have multiple
brands in the Netherlands is already sort of an outlier. It is tolerated as
long as we perform um launching new
brands. It's at least from a
governance perspective, wewould have to do a lot of explaining in
Sweden.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 32:22
Um And of course, I think the energy markets shoot good um sea room
for very specialized, very targeted brands. But the evidence is also that
it has been tried a lot of times there are 60suppliers in the Netherlands
or so and they all say they areunique and none of them is.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 32:54
Well, I think the real life challenges areuh really have eaten.
R-Raban - Interviewer 33:00
The the strategy for power care is to remain as a individual grant under
Father Asa or well, it is, it is um another question on this. So to make a
move that has, that has been presented in this overview. Um Yeah, what
kind of strategic partners uh do you see to play a critical role in that. And
where do you also see gaps?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 33:26
Well, the solution uh column, I don't thinkwe let any partners at the
moment. We do have partnersfor heat pump pumpsfor solar, for ev
.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 33:37
Um So uh please confirm it with you, but I thinkwe're covered on the
home energy services side. We're sort of starting it up.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 33:48
And so there's definitely more partners to connect to. Uh again, that's
the owns uh department.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 33:59
Um depends a little bit also on the solution and the technicalities. So I
don't have the detailsfor it.
R-Raban - Interviewer 34:06
Yeah. And if he is there, uhwhat kind of partnerships um are in place for
that?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 34:12
around
We have a partnership withKiauh or power supply and uhvehicle
degrade stu
ff, flexible ev charging.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 34:24
Uh I think that's the main one, the feeling that there's another one, but
please ask you. Um Yeah, doesn't pop up.
R-Raban - Interviewer 34:35
Thanks. All right. Uh Thank you
for elaborating on this. Uh Wewould like
to talk a bit about uh the customers. Um And yeah, to the extent
possible for you, of course to answer. Um But our first question is, yeah,
how does our security segment its customers?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 34:54
P Iwould say we don't and ifwe segment them, we segment them by N
PV, which is of course not the marketing criteria but an internal one.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 35:09
Um And this is a little bit black andwhite. What I say we're able to
segment and buy uh the consumption uh if they own the house or hire it
uh the the the the construction year of the house and all kinds of data,
but really segmenting in the marketing classical way and then targeting
a segment and creating your proposition, the f
ull proposition around that
segment. That's something that we do. It's exactly what we're trying to
achievewith this latest strategy update and, andwhat's theview on the
strategy team on uh on how this will evolve and especially which
customer segments most growthum in terms of customer accretion can
help. So far. I'm pretty pleasedwith the results because I see that the
segmentation and also the need to develop a round proposition for that
segment is being picked up by London by Iron by Fleurs or the people
who really need to operate it or operateuhuh implement it. Uh I also see
that they're struggling a little bit on uhuh how exactly do I need to do
this and that, but that's a logical consequence of the process.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 36:33
But this is actually the first time that I really see peopleworking together
across the board to try to comeup with a complete solution, a complete
proposition for a certain marketing segment. Andwhether it's the right
segment or not, you could argue about it for ages, sounds maybe a little
bit relaxed, but I don't really care as long as we get the trick right?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 37:01
And then can multiply it a couple of times because the, the times when
we could do it with a sort of one size fits all approach through a, a price
comparison website is is gone.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 37:19
Yeah.
R-Raban - Interviewer 37:20
Um So to summarize, um it's, it's, yeah, in your perspective, it's not
happeninguh at this moment a lot. Um um in, in terms of classical
marketing approaches, um there is away to classify based on solution
use. And there, then I think there's eight groups. Um And you mentioned
one other uh aspect that was presented, I think in the latest strategy
update.
R-Raban - Interviewer 37:47
Um So, so you mentioned uhwe try to achievewhat we try to achieve
with the latest strategy update. Uh Can you help mewhat theupdate
was around customer segmentation?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 37:59
It was about customer segmentation.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 38:03
Yeah, I think I thinkwhat he meant was this is exactly what they're trying
to do with the latest update on the strategic piece.
G Giovanna 38:12
Yeah.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 38:14
Yeah. So, so our annual study update for the consumer segment, it's
never revolutionary. It's always a sort of evolutionary approach. We keep
a lot in that is still valid andwe, we change around the fringes. Um Well,
maybe not always the fringes, but you get what I mean. Um And so one
of the things that we put emphasis on in this strategy update is the need
to segment the market. And the fact that that, that the traditional classic
customer with Eng and a homeuh gas boiler is still the majority, but it's
a majority that's rapidly declining. And if you
want to be relevant to your
market, to your customers, you need to start paying attention to all
those other segments.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 39:04
And the problem, of course, with all the other segment is that there are
so many, whereas E plus de plus boiler used to be one big segment. And
so Yolanda and our team, I think have a big struggle and a big barrier to
overcome to sort of manage this complexity with the same number of
people because there's no room to expand in thewith FTEs.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 39:31
Um So that, that's tough. Yeah, but it also offers you nice opportunities
for new acquisition channels, new revenue sources, et cetera.
R-Raban - Interviewer 39:42
Exactly. OK, clear then we at least know what, what this situation also is
on that. Um uh Talking about customer of consumer strategy. Um What,
what do you see as met needs and pain points um among energy
customers that could be an opportunity for f to jump on at this moment.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 40:04
I think the the biggest pain point, at least for a lot of customer is simply
price.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 40:11
The prices are not as high as they used to be in the energy crisis, but,
but structurally, they're twice as high as before the Ukrainian invasion.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 40:23
R
ussian invasion, I should say. Um So a lot of people are strugglingwith
their energy bills.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 40:32
Another pain point is that everybody knows, sort of in the back of their
heads that they need to decarbonize at some point in time. But either
they don't have the means or they don't have the ability and sometimes,
also not thewillingness and maybe sometimes all three.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 40:52
Um, and so, and the government doesn't really help at the moment.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 40:59
So that's, that's not a pain point.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 41:02
And third, maybe something that did not really yet really materializing,
but at I DC coming is getting more and more complex for customers
again. Now you used to have ENG on your energy bill and then maybe
for your gas boiler, you got, you got the bill from the installation
company and now you're going to have either flex prices and maybe also
a battery or a EV and netting or not netting. You need to sort of have a
phd to struggle to find it all out, not going to happen.
R-Raban - Interviewer 41:45
I have to say, I have to say, coming from Brazil and starting and setting
up energy here.
G Giovanna 41:54
Yeah, I have a phd and it wasn't enough.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 42:00
Exactly my point. I mean, so you, you've proven that you're smart.
G Giovanna 42:06
I still, I still don't understand. I have to say, yeah, I can imagine.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 42:11
I mean, imagine the situation of someonewith, with a little less brain.
Um, but they still, they need to go through that f
unnel.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 42:24
So, yeah, the average customer does have a lot of pains I guess they're
not all urgent and it's easy to push the, the pain of decarbonisation
f
urther down your agenda. The pain of the energy bill is real and today
complexity is, is, is a nuisance, maybe more than a pain and the gains.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 42:48
Yeah, I don't know.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 42:51
My assumption is that everybody who really is, um, green and
sustainable from the inside, they have already done it. Uh, solar panels
on the roof. Ev in front of the house, et cetera. Yeah. And now it's the
great majority.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 43:15
It was their game.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 43:17
Yeah, I can't promise them a lower energy bill. I can only promise them a
higher energy bill.
R-Raban - Interviewer 43:26
And this is the big challenge I take right, affordability and combination of
sustainability.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 43:33
Exactly.
R-Raban - Interviewer 43:34
That will be the challenge.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 43:36
Yeah. So there's maybe a little bit, I don't know, it could be inside, it
could be outside your assignment, but it's certainly something that's
going to hit our customers uh in the, in the years to come. Yeah.
R-Raban - Interviewer 43:51
Yeah. Now it's a thoughtf
ul planning to engage like in that journey
together with the customer sustainable.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 43:57
We'reworking on the affordability strategy but it it's not final yet. We're
still heavily in discussing it. So it's just nothing to share yet, but it's on
our radar screen. Sustainability. I thinkwe have a clear plan. Wewant to
decarbonise our customer base and it's also not very complicated. At
least not for the consumer side of things, but of course, we need the
cooper operation of our customers. We're going to just force a heat
bump on them and it will be nice. Um So yeah, that's, that's gonna be a
tough one.
R-Raban - Interviewer 44:31
Yeah. And can you maybe share that climate champion slide here on the
right side? Yeah, I sorry. 1111more. Yeah, so uhwe, we saw this overview
um might also be from your team.
R-Raban - Interviewer 44:51
Um So, so could you help me to understand a bit more? Um uhwhat F
four aims to do? So, for example, uh in attract households with low cot
co2potential. Um And your team rights use flexible product
management and armor math. Can you elaborate a bit on that initiative
or that direction?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 45:12
Maybe I should start with. The third one, I facilitate co two reduction was
basically offering the right solutionsfor a customer to decarbonize. I
think that's very straightforward. That's what we have always done and,
and have expanded over the past couple of years if you, if you have any
questions about it, happy to answer them. But I think that's, that's, I
mean ob
vious.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 45:35
Um But then Iwas talking about the big complexities, that's what the
customer needs help with and that's column two.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 45:48
So just to name an example, but I thinkwithin the scope of your
assignment, if you now look in our, on our website and you
want to try to
find out uh Giovanna coming from Brazil. Should I do a heat pump in my
house? Which one?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 46:08
Which capacity? What do I need to consider? Blah, blah, blah. Good
luck. It's not there. Yeah, working on it, by theway. Uh Before I get any
slap in the face from a couple of colleagues, but it's not there.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 46:24
Well, our subsidiary face style is one of the biggest installation
companies of feed pumps in the Nes. They have all the knowledge but
it's not on our website. So apart from the fact that it's maybe not a
revenue model, we let our customers down there.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 46:42
That's why wherewe emphasized again, we do not only need to offer
the solution, but we need to help the customer through that customer
journey or through that f
unnel until the seals moment and maybe also in
the after seals.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 46:57
And then number one, basically, we are a sustainable company.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 47:06
And so wewant for customers who fit withus, not only based on price
but also based on attitude or again, perception.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 47:24
And our basic assumption is is if you
feel that fell is not only offering you
a fair bill, but you also really belong in this company. The chances are
that you're not gonna cheer or at least not as easily as someone else. So
we should be attracting the customers who really fit with this company
and that's the customers with the lowest emissions or the highest
degree of decarbonisation.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 47:59
It's the customer base that we can workwith.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 48:03
If you're just here for price, it will be gone next year. Probably. What can I
do?
R-Raban - Interviewer 48:12
This is avery specific, so it's very specific element in the acquisition
strategy to focus then on attracting low co2potential household.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 48:23
So to give an example, wewould like to attract more customers who
already have a heat pump.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 48:30
I don't have the capacity of the solutions column to install them in the
numbers. The fad starts too small but I do have the capacity to operate
and to maintain them with F andwe're excellent at doing it. And maybe if
it's a smart heat pump, I also have the capacity to organize your home
energy management for you in combination with your solar panels and
your EV. And then it gets interesting, I'm less dependent on the margin
on the electricity contract, but I have all revenue bills on locks. That's
the thinking. It's not real yet. But that's the question is, is this, is this
opinion on attracting low CO2?
G Giovanna 49:17
Well, the highest level of decarbonization customers to the database. So
proving this quality into attracting to the f
unnel. Is this a polemic opinion
or is this a opinion shared throughout the company?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 49:34
At least it's shared inRBU
because this study has been approved, of
course, by our management team. I don't know what the rest of the
company would think of it and, and basically, they don't, they don't ask
we don't tell and you know, we don't need to. But why are you asking?
Do you see this as controversial or? No?
G Giovanna 49:57
Because then it's a clear scope for us then that, that helps thevision
that we need to set for the project.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 50:06
For me, it's, it's a given. But please ask yon you if they say something
different, we should get back together on it. But this is a proved
strategy.
R-Raban - Interviewer 50:18
So that that would also mean less emphasis on those other customer
groups or maybe even. Yeah. So, so uh you
will allow them as customers
but not target that maybe anymore.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 50:29
Exactly. And it's one of the main discussion points when we presented
this strategy, it was by some colleagues perceived as ditching some
customer groups. But that's not the case. This is about making choices
and targeting customers. That's not saying that you ditch the other
ones. It's just that they give some customer segments more attention
and more focus than the other ones and the rest, they're just as
welcome.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 51:04
And there is a strategy.
G Giovanna 51:07
Yeah, of course. I mean, it's always, we always say that if you have a
good sign of a goodvision or a good strategy is that you make people
unhappy in your company, right?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 51:20
Yes, we definitely succeeded in that.
G Giovanna 51:25
Um So what you're saying in clear here, you're saying that based on this
strategy, um but fall is aiming to attract customers that haveum a a
closer relationship to the purpose and to thevision of 2030which is
empowering the transition. Therefore, wewant to attract that sales
f
unnel um customers that focus on sustainability and more sustainable
solutions. Andwe're not only talking about solar panels, we're talking
about the entire chain and solution providing, right?
G Giovanna 52:03
Ok, clear, maybe one nance, there are a lot of customers who don't give
a about the climate they're in for the subsidy or for uh the status that
they have a Tesla in front of their house.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 52:21
That'sfinewith me. I I care about the fact that you have those carbon
free solutions and that gives me an angle to workwith you as a
customer. Your motivation is relevant, of course, for communications
and branding, et cetera. Uh But from a strategic point ofview, it doesn't
really matter much to me.
R-Raban - Interviewer 52:47
And I even think right, withwhen the prices of energy increase and the
sustainability goes down on the priority list. So that's the big challenge,
right?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 52:56
And there's only maybe 1020% of the Dutch population is really say a
green climate activist andwe'll probably gain some of those customers.
But as long as we don't bridge that perception gap, they probably
remain at green joy and pure energy, et cetera. But for the great majority
of the Dutch population, this is enough.
R-Raban - Interviewer 53:21
Yeah, thanks. And I seewe have still three minutes left. Iwant to open
the floor a bit um with a final question uh and maybe also send you have
some or some questions to us. Um But wewerewondering, you have
been some around some time in voda all in the strategy department.
And um we are now just starting as a new team with this strategic
question. Um Yeah, is there any advice you
want to giveus or um any
comments you
want to makeuh about this project and how to be
successf
ul?
S- Sven - Strategy Director 53:53
Well, Iwould um advise you, recommend you and cheer you if you make
it uh painf
ul in Dutch. So he, I don't know how to translate this in English
for the moment, but I guess you get the meaning.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 54:16
Um We, we need solutionsfrom you or advice from you that really
makes us think scratch the back of our heads and hurt because the easy
stu
ffwe can do ourselves. And that didn't work like the advice.
R-Raban - Interviewer 54:44
And also there's a nice mandate for IGO through Ffour will be more f
un.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 54:49
Yeah, I didn't, I didn't, it's not up to me to give you the mandate.
R-Raban - Interviewer 54:54
I know wewill give it time to ourselves.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 54:58
I'm pretty, I know you
very well. We get alongvery well. Iwouldn't be
surprised if you, once you have the same mandate or did maybe already
gave it, gave it to you.
R-Raban - Interviewer 55:10
I think a lot of other people agreewith you and Gio may be talking to us
a bit about next steps. And uh also, yeah, how we can involve him. Um I
think you sent out some advice for Igo for sessions. Exactly.
G Giovanna 55:26
So, um you
were involved in a few sessions. I'm not sure if all of them uh
I'll double check, but um we have as mentioned. So we're, we're starting
off, we're in the first week of the project. This is the moment really
together, everyone's point ofview, perspective, vision and to get a f
ull
picture ofwhat are the biggest challenges the blockers, the potential
leversfor us. Right now, we're also doing some desk research to give an
outside in perspective on the market andwhere to go. Um Andwe're
also going to be talking to potential customers to make sure that we are
catering for andwe'revalidating these assumptions aroundwhat are
those main needs and most severe pain points.
G Giovanna 56:14
And in two weeks, we're going to have an start to ideate on opportunity
area solutions. Andwe're going to be sharing that out. I'm going to make
sure to involve you along theway and um it might be Sven that we, that
we still have a few questions looking at you to understandwhether we
could reach out um to get your perspective on uh on the follow
up
questions that might appear.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 56:40
Sure, sure, you may notice that uh or if you haven't already noticed that
you also sent an invitation to high staffwith my team who made all these
slides and he's, he's aw
f
ully busy because I made him. Uh, so I'm, I'm
keeping it a little bit out of this, uh, project if that really starts to hurt, let
me know, but I'm trying to cover for my team here.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 57:07
So if you have any follow
up questions, please direct them first to me
and I'll be happy to help.
R-Raban - Interviewer 57:14
We have an interview. I thinkwe have 30minutes onMonday with him.
G Giovanna 57:19
Let's keep the 30minutes because I think it's important just to talk to
him. But let'sfocus the contact point in you then it's been moving
forward. Brilliant. Thanksfor clarifying this.
G Giovanna 57:31
Thank you so much. I have to jump to another one. We really appreciate
your time. We know it's a busy schedule, especially end of year. So it
was very helpf
ul andvery
valuable as well.
S- Sven - Strategy Director 57:43
You'rewelcome. Thank you
very much.
R-Raban - Interviewer 57:46
You have a good day. See you soon.
